# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a ROM-hack base derived from the **Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones**
(GBA) decompilation. The expansion output is not required to be
byte-identical to the original ROM.

This repository's default, supported contribution path is the **modern
`arm-none-eabi` GCC/AAPCS release framework** (see
[`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) and
[`docs/framework-support.md`](docs/framework-support.md)). The original
agbcc-based decompilation build is preserved as an explicit, separate
**archival** lane (`make legacy` / `make fireemblem8.gba`) for
byte-for-byte decomp-matching work only — see
[`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md). Start from the
[documentation index](docs/README.md) or
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow;
this file only covers what an AI agent needs while editing code in this
repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Default, supported path: modern release ROM, boot-verified (no agbcc involved)
make

# Equivalent explicit form
make all

# Archival lane: agbcc-based fireemblem8.gba, explicit target required
make legacy -j$(nproc)   # equivalently: make fireemblem8.gba -j$(nproc)

# Clean all build artifacts (slow — recompresses battle animations)
make clean

# Clean everything except battle animation compression outputs (preferred)
make clean_fast
```

A bare `make`/`make all` always builds and boot-verifies the modern
release ROM and never requires, builds, or resolves to a `tools/agbcc`
executable or library. Modern ROM correctness is judged by successful
link, boot, and runtime behavior, not by equality with the vanilla ROM;
the archival lane remains available for byte-level matching investigations
without a whole-source/object/ROM identity hash gate.

## Remote Completion Gate

For any task that changes tracked files, local implementation and tests are
not completion. Unless the user explicitly says not to commit or push, commit
and push all intended changes, wait for Build CI on the exact pushed commit,
and require `make remote-completion-check` to pass before reporting completion.

For an objective to resolve all repository issues, also close the resolved
issues, wait for Release Rehearsal on the exact pushed commit, and require
`make all-issues-completion-check` to pass. Track commit, push, CI, and issue
closure as explicit dependent todos from the start.

First-time setup: `./scripts/quickstart.sh` installs/probes the modern
toolchain (and libmGBA) by default, **no agbcc of any kind**; pass
`--legacy` (or `--refresh-agbcc`) only when you need the archival lane,
which installs agbcc instead. A legally obtained `baserom.gba` is
optional and only needed by `asmdiff.sh`. See
[`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for full setup/troubleshooting
and [`docs/framework-support.md`](docs/framework-support.md) for exactly
which hosts/toolchains/targets are supported vs. archival-only.

Persistent feature/profile choices use `./configure --help` followed by
`make`. The generated `config.autotools.mk` and `GNUmakefile` are ignored;
direct `make VAR=value` remains supported for one-off overrides.

Authoring game content (characters/classes/items/supports/etc.) goes
through the generated-data platform rather than hand-written C tables —
see [`docs/generated_data_tutorial.md`](docs/generated_data_tutorial.md)
(`make generated-data-validate`, `-generate`, `-check`, `-test`).


Optional starter features are four default-off, fingerprinted flags with
validated dependencies; never infer the profile from the item cap alone. See
[`docs/starter_features.md`](docs/starter_features.md). Expansion UI strings
and locale IDs use the independent catalog under `texts/expansion/`; see
[`docs/localization.md`](docs/localization.md) and run the stdlib localization
suite before changing registry/catalog data.

## Compiler & Toolchain

- **Modern (default release lane)**: `arm-none-eabi` GCC targeting AAPCS.
  No agbcc of any kind is involved in `make`/`make all`.
- **agbcc (archival lane only)**: a modified GCC 2.95 targeting ARM7TDMI
  (Thumb/ARM interwork), located at `tools/agbcc/`, used only by
  `make legacy` / `make fireemblem8.gba`. This is **C89-era** — no `//`
  comments in compiled code, no C99 features.
  - Compiler flags: `-mthumb-interwork -Wimplicit -Wparentheses -Werror -O2 -fhex-asm`
  - Source is preprocessed with `cpp`, piped through `iconv` (UTF-8 → CP932), then compiled with `agbcc`
  - Some files use `old_agbcc` or different flags — see per-file overrides in `Makefile`

## Architecture

### Archival decomp workflow

Assembly lives in `asm/`, decompiled C goes in `src/`. The linking order
in `ldscript.txt` determines ROM layout. When decompiling a function: add
`src/x.o(.text)` **before** `asm/x.o(.text)` in `ldscript.txt`, remove the
function from the `.s` file, and write the C equivalent in `src/x.c`. The
full tutorial, rules, setup steps, and asset-extraction references live
in [`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md) — this is
archival-lane-only guidance for byte-for-byte matching work, not the
default modern framework path described above.

### Proc System (Cooperative Multitasking)

The engine uses a **Proc** system (`include/proc.h`, `src/proc.c`) — a tree-based cooperative scheduler. Game entities are `struct Proc` with script tables (`struct ProcCmd[]`) defining behavior as command sequences: `PROC_CALL`, `PROC_REPEAT`, `PROC_SLEEP`, `PROC_YIELD`, `PROC_START_CHILD_BLOCKING`, etc. Local proc structs embed `PROC_HEADER` at offset 0 and add custom fields after.

### Memory Sections

- `EWRAM_DATA` — variables in external work RAM (256 KB), used for large/global game state
- `CONST_DATA` / `SECTION(".data")` — data that logically should be `const` but was in `.data` in the original binary
- `EWRAM_OVERLAY(id)` — overlaid EWRAM sections for memory reuse between screens

### Key Subsystems

- **Units**: `struct Unit` / `struct CharacterData` / `struct ClassData` in `bmunit.h`. Arrays: `gUnitArrayBlue` (player), `gUnitArrayRed` (enemy), `gUnitArrayGreen` (NPC), `gUnitArrayPurple`
- **Events**: scripted cutscenes via event engine (`src/event.c`, `src/eventscr*.c`)
- **Battle animations**: `src/banim-*.c` — largest subsystem. Data in `banim/` with custom compression linker (`scripts/arm_compressing_linker.py`)
- **World map**: `src/worldmap_*.c`
- **Text system**: source in `texts/*.txt`, processed by `scripts/texttools/` into `src/msg_data.c` and `include/constants/msg.h`

## Code Conventions

### Include Order

Every `.c` file starts with `#include "global.h"` as the **first** include. This pulls in GBA types, `prelude.h`, `types.h`, `variables.h`, and `functions.h`. Then constants headers (`constants/*.h`), then module headers.

### Naming

- Functions and types: `PascalCase` (`Proc_Start`, `struct Unit`, `GetItemAttributes`)
- Global variables: `gCamelCase` (`gActiveUnitId`, `gPaletteBuffer`)
- Static/local variables: `sCamelCase` (`sProcArray`, `sKeyStatusBuffer`)
- Constants/enums: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (`UNIT_LEVEL_MAX`, `PROC_MARK_EVENT`)
- Many functions retain `sub_XXXXXXXX` placeholder names from ROM addresses (renaming these to descriptive names is part of the archival decompilation effort)

### Struct Layout

Struct fields are annotated with byte offset comments: `/* 0C */ struct Vec2 camera;`

### Header Guards

All headers use `#ifndef GUARD_FILENAME_H` / `#define GUARD_FILENAME_H`.

### Formatting

`.clang-format` configured: Allman braces, 4-space indent, 100-column limit, no tabs. `global.h` is always sorted first in includes.

### Legacy Layout Constraints

The current migration still relies on original ABI and data-layout details:
- Preserve register-sensitive code only where the legacy compiler still requires it
- `STRUCT_PAD(from, to)` pads struct fields to preserve explicit layout
- `SHOULD_BE_CONST` marks data that must stay writable for legacy placement
