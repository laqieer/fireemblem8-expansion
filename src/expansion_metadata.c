/*
 * The embedded expansion framework metadata record (see
 * include/expansion_metadata.h). Populated entirely from the
 * FE8_EXPANSION_* macros (include/expansion_config.h), which the modern
 * build supplies via `-D` command-line defines derived from config.mk and
 * MODERN_CONFIG/MODERN_ABI/MODERN_ROM_SIZE (see modern.mk). Uses
 * positional (not designated) initialization for C89/agbcc compatibility.
 *
 * This file is picked up (compiled) by both the legacy and modern C
 * source globs, but is only linked into the modern ROM: linker/expansion.ld
 * pulls in every object's .rodata via a generic wildcard rule, while
 * ldscript.txt (legacy) only links objects it lists explicitly, and does
 * not list this one.
