/*
 * Stable expansion framework locale/message identifiers and runtime
 * resolver API (issue #18).
 *
 * ExpansionLocaleId/ExpansionMsgId are brand-new, independently numbered
 * identifier spaces -- never alias or reuse GetLang()/SetLang()/
 * gLanguageMode (vanilla language runtime), any vanilla MSG_* id
 * (include/constants/msg.h), or any XMAP magic/identifier. Nothing here
 * reads, decodes, or depends on the vanilla texts/texts.txt ->
 * src/msg_data.c pipeline, its Huffman decode cache, or gMsgTable.
 *
 * Every message/locale string this framework ships is new, original
 * expansion-framework text from authored UTF-8 catalogs (plus a
 * deterministic ASCII pseudo-locale transform of English -- see
 * scripts/localization/pseudo.py); this file and src/expansion_locale.c
 * never contain vanilla dialogue or any FE8J/EU/CN original-game text.
 *
 * The canonical message registry/catalog source lives under
 * texts/expansion/ (registry.json + catalog.<locale>.json); the generated,
 * per-build C catalog (never committed -- see scripts/localization/
 * generate.py and modern.mk's "Localization catalog" section) is written
 * under build/expansion-localization/generated/ and defines the `extern`
 * data declared below. The resolver API remains independent of the
 * separate save/preferences and language-menu APIs.
 *
 * This file is compiled by both the legacy (agbcc) and modern (GCC)
 * source globs -- like include/expansion_metadata.h/src/expansion_metadata.c
 * (issue #8) -- but src/expansion_locale.c is only linked into the modern
 * ROM (see linker/expansion.ld's generic .rodata/.text wildcard vs.
 * ldscript.txt's explicit legacy object list, which never names it).
 * Consequently every symbol declared `extern` here must stay compilable
 * (not necessarily linkable) under strict C89/agbcc.

 * currently populate EN, JA, ZH_HANS, and QPS_PLOC. Product configuration
 * still gates JA/ZH_HANS until the common CJK font/renderer and full game
