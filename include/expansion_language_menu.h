/*
 * First-start blocking language selector + later settings submenu
 * runtime glue (issue #18 sprint 3).
 *
 * This header/its implementation (src/expansion_language_menu.c) is
 * compiled by both the legacy (agbcc) and modern (GCC) source globs --
 * like include/expansion_locale.h/src/expansion_locale.c -- but the
 * implementation is only *linked* into the modern ROM (see ldscript.txt's
 * explicit legacy object list, which never names it). Every symbol
 * declared here must therefore stay compilable (not necessarily
 * linkable) under strict C89/agbcc; every call site that actually
 * *invokes* one of these symbols from a dual-linked file (src/gamecontrol.c,
 * src/uiconfig.c) must itself be guarded by `#ifdef MODERN` so the legacy
 * link never needs these symbols to exist.
 *
 * Never reads/writes GetLang()/SetLang()/gLanguageMode, any vanilla MSG_*
 * id, or gMsgTable -- only include/expansion_locale.h's
 * ExpansionLocale_ family and include/expansion_save_prefs.h's
 * ExpansionUserPrefs_ family (both consumed, never modified, by this
 * module). Does not resize struct GameOption's fixed `selectors[4]`
 * array, and does not touch Title_IDLE or any issue #11 debug hotkey.
