/*
 * Versioned/checksummed expansion user save preferences (issue #18
 * sprint 2): the persisted, per-save record of the player's own locale
 * selection, distinct from -- and never derived from -- the build-time
 * locale configuration (FE8_EXPANSION_DEFAULT_LOCALE_ID/
 * FE8_EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALE_MASK, include/expansion_config.h) or the
 * runtime resolver's in-memory current locale (src/expansion_locale.c).
 *
 * struct ExpansionUserPrefs lives at a fixed byte offset
 * (EXPANSION_USER_PREFS_META_OFFSET) inside struct ExpansionSaveMeta's
 * previously-fully-unused `reserved` tail (include/save_format.h) --
 * i.e. its absolute SRAM offset is
 * SRAM_OFFSET_EXPANSION_SAVE_META + 0x30 + EXPANSION_USER_PREFS_META_OFFSET.
 * This does NOT move SRAM_OFFSET_EXPANSION_SAVE_META, struct
 * ExpansionSaveMeta's own size (0x5C) or its 0x00-0x2F named-field
 * layout/checksum domain, or any neighboring struct SaveBlocks field
 * (in particular `xmap`) -- see docs/save_format.md and
 * scripts/modernize/tests/test_save_format_layout.py.
 *
 * struct ExpansionSaveMeta's own checksum only covers bytes [0x00, 0x2E)
 * (EXPANSION_SAVE_META_SIZE_FOR_CHECKSUM) and therefore never covers this
 * record -- it carries its own independent magic/version/checksum so it
 * can be validated (and migrated) on its own, exactly like
 * ExpansionSaveMeta itself is validated independently of the vanilla
 * struct GlobalSaveInfo header. See EXPANSION_USER_PREFS_SIZE_FOR_CHECKSUM
 * below.
 *
 * No-wipe contract: every function below that classifies or reads an
 * on-disk record NEVER calls WipeSram() (src/bmsave-lib.c) or otherwise
 * touches any byte outside this record's own fixed
 * EXPANSION_USER_PREFS_META_OFFSET..+sizeof(struct ExpansionUserPrefs)
 * window. An unset (all-zero -- every pre-sprint-2 "current" save's
 * reserved tail was always deterministically zeroed by
 * BuildCurrentExpansionSaveMeta(), never left as uninitialized garbage --
 * see src/bmsave-lib.c) or all-0xFF (the documented blank-SRAM fill
 * pattern) record classifies as EXPANSION_USER_PREFS_UNSET, never
 * CORRUPT; an unknown/disabled locale id or a checksum mismatch never
 * triggers any SRAM mutation, only a runtime fallback + "requires
 * prompt" signal (see ExpansionUserPrefs_Normalize below).
 *
 * All Build/Checksum/ValidateRaw/Load/Normalize functions here are pure
 * struct-and-macro logic (no expansion_locale.c symbol references), so
 * this header/its bmsave-lib.c implementation compiles AND links under
 * both the legacy agbcc build and every modern build cell, exactly like
 * include/save_format.h. Only ExpansionUserPrefs_Store (which must call
 * ExpansionLocale_SetCurrent()/ExpansionLocale_InvalidateCache() to keep
 * the runtime resolver's cache coherent with what was just persisted) is
 * implemented in src/expansion_save_prefs.c, which -- like
 * src/expansion_locale.c -- is compiled by both builds (agbcc must be
 * able to typecheck it) but only linked into the modern ROM (see
 * ldscript.txt's explicit legacy object list, which names neither file,
 * and modern.mk's `wildcard src/*.c`).
