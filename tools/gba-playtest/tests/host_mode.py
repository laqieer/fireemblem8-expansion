"""Central, explicit host-only mode contract for the tools/gba-playtest suite.

Public contract (the ONLY supported switch, mirrored verbatim by
.github/workflows/build.yml `host-tests` and scripts/upstream_port/verify.py):

    GBA_PLAYTEST_HOST_ONLY=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/gba-playtest/tests -v

Why this module exists (issue #10 / #13 integrated-harness defect): the
ROM-dependent tests in this suite used to decide *live emulator run vs. skip*
purely from whether a build artifact happened to exist in the working tree
(build/expansion-modern/<config>/aapcs/fireemblem8.gba, ./fireemblem8.gba).
build/ is git-ignored and user-owned, so that made the **host** gate a
function of local artifact timing rather than of an explicit mode: a clean CI
checkout skipped, while a local worktree holding a stale (or concurrently
rebuilding) ROM silently ran live captures against it and reported
fingerprint failures that say nothing about the commit under test. `python3
-m scripts.upstream_port verify --jobs 2` makes that strictly worse, because
its later build gates rewrite exactly those artifacts.

Contract:

* Host-only mode is decided ONLY by this environment variable -- never by the
  presence, absence, freshness, mtime or content of any artifact.
* In host-only mode every ROM-dependent / live-integration test raises
  unittest.SkipTest BEFORE it opens, stats, hashes or otherwise touches any
  ROM/ELF/save artifact, even when debug, release and legacy artifacts all
  exist, and even when one appears mid-run because a build is running
  concurrently.
* Normal mode (variable unset, or an explicit false value) keeps the previous
  behavior exactly: artifact present -> live run, artifact absent -> the same
  explicit skip as before.
* Live/runtime coverage is owned by the runtime + build gates
  (`make expansion-modern-linker-check`,
  `make expansion-modern-itemexpansion-check` -- build.yml `build` job and
  the last four of the ten scripts/upstream_port/verify.py gates), never by
  this host lane. Nothing here needs a fingerprint refresh or a `clean`.

Classification of every module under tools/gba-playtest/tests:

  Category A -- host-only safe, always runs (reads no repository ROM/ELF and
  consumes no pre-existing build artifact as an oracle): test_scenario,
  test_serialization, test_diagnostics, test_timeouts, test_retry_policy
  (mocked subprocesses + TemporaryDirectory ROM stubs), test_sram_fixture,
  test_sram_hash_normalization, test_save_compat_gate_safety,
  test_stub_scenarios, test_pointer_oracle_audit, test_baseline_no_autorefresh,
  test_debugtools_registry (real project C sources compiled for the *host*),
  test_backend_integration (libmGBA against a homebrew ROM generated into a
  TemporaryDirectory), test_host_only_mode (this contract) and
  test_debugtools_sram_fixture. The last one is host-only safe but is the one
  Category A module that writes into build/: it regenerates its own
  deterministic debugtools SRAM fixture from source through the
  toolchain-free Make recipe it is testing. That is source-derived and
  mode-independent (identical in host-only and in normal mode); it never
  reads a ROM/ELF and never treats a pre-existing artifact as an oracle.

  Category B -- ROM-dependent live integration, skipped in host-only mode.
  Registered in LIVE_TEST_CLASSES below; test_host_only_mode.py fails if a
  registered class is not guarded, or if a module builds a repository ROM
  path without being registered.
