# Issue #18 final localization closure evidence

**Final branch-local state (2026-08-11):** Japanese and Simplified Chinese
each cover all 3,414 compressed FE8U messages and all 143 audited raw
surfaces. English fallback, raw exclusion, unresolved records, unapproved
runtime leakage, payload mismatch, and disallowed-script leakage are all
zero. Japanese raw goal strings are bound to the pinned live FE8J ROM through
the committed full-ROM hash, exact offsets/slices, and independently locked
range proof. Both locales have complete system/talk font inventories, and all
modern CJK runtime consumers use the shared FE control/UTF-8 tokenization and
bounded substitution contract.

**Current integration clarification (2026-08-14):** this report's 12-gate
localization evidence now matches live `verify.gates()`: localization is the
fourth mirrored gate. The issues #7/#17 documentation-governance gate remains
an additional standalone workflow step and is not mirrored.

Status: **final branch-local implementation closure evidence for
reviewer/verifier. It does not assert the remote GitHub issue state or an
online CI URL.** The historical sprint sections below map their frozen
contracts to concrete code, scenarios, and tests; the final-state summary
above supersedes their intermediate scope/status wording. It builds on Sprint 1
(`5436ec27`), Sprint 2 (`795d2abd`, `6b9fe068`), and Sprint 3 (`b746df2c`,
`92ed1b6b`) rather than duplicating their host-only test coverage.

**Sprint 5 addendum (this commit)**: fixed every Harness review/verifier
finding raised against this report's sprint-4 claims, closing all three
previously-descoped items for real (see the WHAT #2-3 section above and
"Historical scope items now closed" below) plus four additional real defects:

1. **Multi-locale clean-build header-path DAG bug**: a clean, uncached,
   non-`-j` multi-locale build could race two configs'/output roots'
   generated-header prerequisites against each other. Root-caused to
   `modern.mk`'s `MODERN_LOCALIZATION_ROOT`/`MODERN_LOCALE_MULTI_BUILD_
   ROOT` not being config/output-root-specific; fixed by deriving both
   from `$(MODERN_BUILD_ROOT)`, and locked in with a new cold debug/release
   `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check` regression run with
   no cache and no `-j` (`scripts/modernize/tests/test_modern_
   localization_header_bootstrap.py`'s `ModernLocalizationMultiCheckColdCleanTests`).
2. **Prefs-corruption "no-wipe" SRAM-hash false red**: root-caused an
   undocumented, vanilla `SramInit()` hardware self-test scratch-pad
   write (`gSram->reserved`, offset `0x73A0`, 4 bytes) as a second
   locale-unrelated noise source beyond the already-known `SoundRoomSaveData`
   struct. Fixed by adding it as a third, explicit `sram_hash_exclude_
   ranges` entry (never by deleting the whole-SRAM comparison) plus new,
   real per-byte probes covering it, `ExpansionSaveMeta`'s own magic/
   checksum, and the untouched XMAP region's magic/checksum/`save_magic32`
   -- proving these regions are stable/known rather than silently masked.
3. **Real settings navigation / real soft-reset persistence / visible
   pseudo marker**: implemented for real (see WHAT #2-3 above); no longer
   descoped.
4. **Shifted-check success log printed the wrong path**: `expansion-
   modern-localization-runtime-shifted-check`'s success `printf` referenced
   `$(MODERN_LOCALE_MULTI_ROM)` instead of the actual shifted-build output
   path; fixed to print `$(MODERN_SHIFTED_OUTDIR)`.

No fixture is described as a reboot; no whole-framebuffer/whole-SRAM
comparison was deleted to hide unexplained drift; every fingerprint this
sprint touched was captured via a real `gba_playtest.py capture` run
against a real, freshly-built ROM, never hand-written.

## WHAT checklist

### 1. Probe/backend/schema extension for `ExpansionLanguage` diagnostics

`src/expansion_language_menu.c` (Sprint 3) already exposes a plain, bounded
EWRAM diagnostic struct, `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` (`include/
expansion_language_menu.h`), covering `active`/`settingsActive`/
`promptShown`/`autoSelected`/`promptReason`/`prefsState`/`selectedLocale`/
`currentLocale`/`enabledLocaleCount`/`cacheGeneration`/`startupRunCount`/
`settingsOpenCount`/`settingsChangeCount` -- exactly current locale, cache
generation, prefs status, menu-active, and result, as the contract asks.
`tools/gba-playtest`'s existing generic address+size `Probe` mechanism
(`backend.c`, `gba_playtest.py`'s `Probe` class), already used unchanged
for the issue #11 debugtools probe, reads it: a bounded (`probe_count <=
1024`/checkpoint), plain memory read of a known, fixed-layout struct's
fields, **never a raw/arbitrary pointer dereference or a new pointer-chase
oracle**. No backend.c/schema code change was required to satisfy "safely
read" here -- the smallest-diff, Musk-Algorithm-correct move was reusing
the already-reviewed generic mechanism for a new probe struct, not
building a second one.

**New this sprint**: host tests covering "probe schema/bounds" --
`tools/gba-playtest/tests/test_locale_probe_schema.py` (4 tests) compiles
and runs a small driver (`tools/gba-playtest/tests/c/
expansion_language_menu_probe_offsets_driver.c`) against the real,
unmodified header to get the compiler's own `offsetof()`/`sizeof()` for
every field, then cross-checks:

- every `locale-*.json` scenario's hardcoded probe address against
  `base + offsetof(field)` for a real field (`test_every_locale_scenario_
  probe_address_matches_a_documented_field_offset`);
- every probe's `(address, size)` against `sizeof(struct
  ExpansionLanguageMenuProbe)` (`test_every_locale_scenario_probe_
  stays_within_struct_bounds`);
- every probe's declared byte width against its target field's real width
  (`test_every_locale_scenario_probe_size_matches_its_fields_declared_
  width`).

Verified this test suite is a real regression guard, not a tautology: with
`promptShown` temporarily widened from `u8` to `u16` in a scratch copy of
the header, the offset-match test fails deterministically (`3 not found in
{...}`); reverted, all 4 pass again (`git diff --stat
include/expansion_language_menu.h` empty afterward -- the header itself
was never actually left modified).

### 2-3. Semantic scenarios/targets with real assertions (not frame-only)

`tools/gba-playtest/scenarios/locale-*.json` +
`tools/gba-playtest/fingerprints/locale-*.json` (12 scenario/fingerprint
pairs as of sprint 5, real libmGBA captures):

| Scenario | Config(s) | Contract item |
|---|---|---|
| `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-default` | debug, release | Blank SRAM + single-locale (`en`) config: selector reachable/auto-selects before intro/title. |
| `locale-blank-sram-selector-multi` (renamed, issue #18 sprint 6) | debug, release | Blank SRAM + multi-locale (`en,qps-ploc`) config: the selector genuinely shows (`active=1`, `needsPreferenceRepair=1`) pre-title, matching a real `UNSET` fixture's own behavior. **Correction (sprint 6):** this row previously named/asserted `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-multi`, encoding a real runtime bug -- `BuildCurrentExpansionSaveMeta()` unconditionally auto-stamped a syntactically VALID `ExpansionUserPrefs` record on any blank-SRAM boot regardless of enabled-locale count, silently suppressing the mandatory first-start prompt on multi-locale builds. Fixed in `src/bmsave-lib.c`; the old scenario+fingerprint pair (which asserted the suppressed-selector behavior as "expected") has been deleted and superseded by this pair. See `docs/localization.md` and the sprint 6 addendum at the end of this report. |
| `locale-auto-select-single-locale` | debug, release | `UNSET`-prefs real fixture, single enabled locale: `AUTO_SELECT`, `promptShown=0`, no visible selector ("one enabled en auto-select no visible selector" milestone). |
| `locale-selector-multi-switch-qps` | debug | Real selector navigation choosing `qps-ploc`; persisted (`cacheGeneration` bump visible), pseudo path exercised end-to-end. |
| `locale-prefs-corrupt-no-wipe` | debug | Corrupt prefs -> re-prompt; SRAM hash unchanged (see exclusions below): no wipe. |
| `locale-prefs-unknown-locale-no-wipe` | debug | Unknown-locale-id prefs -> re-prompt; SRAM hash unchanged: no wipe. |
| `locale-prefs-disabled-locale-no-wipe` | debug | Prefs naming a locale not compiled into this build -> re-prompt; SRAM hash unchanged: no wipe. |
| `locale-settings-real-navigation-multi` (sprint 5) | debug | Real Prep Map -> Options -> Configuration -> Language -> `RIGHT` navigation opens the real settings submenu; real qps-ploc selection; real Back-cancel-never-mutates-prefs proof; visible pseudo-marker region/pixel checkpoints. |
| `locale-softreset-persistence-multi` (sprint 5) | debug | Real first-run selector chooses qps-ploc; real `A+B+SELECT+START` soft-reset combo reboots via libmGBA's own HLE BIOS; continuous SRAM proves persistence (no selector re-prompt, locale retained). |

Every scenario asserts real `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` field values
(via the schema-locked probe addresses above) plus SRAM hash and/or
framebuffer hash at each checkpoint -- semantic milestones proven by
runtime state actually reached, not merely "N frames elapsed with no
crash." Boot timing uses the same `SKIP_HS`-style key-hold recipe as the
existing `boot.json` family; an earlier attempt using a longer generic
intro-mash sequence was found to accidentally auto-dismiss the selector
before its checkpoint frame, and was abandoned in favor of this
minimal-input, semantically-targeted sequence.

**English/pseudo render + explicit pseudo marker (implemented, sprint 5)**:
a prior sprint's `locale-selector-multi-switch-qps` framebuffer-hash-only
evidence has been superseded -- `locale-settings-real-navigation-multi-
modern-debug` now carries a per-checkpoint `back_row_label` framebuffer
**region** hash (never the whole-screen hash alone) plus two individual
**pixel probes** at the settings submenu's `Back` row, the one row in this
menu resolved in the *current* locale (`ExpansionLocale_ResolveCurrent
(EXP_MSG_FRAMEWORK_BACK)`; every locale-name row is always resolved in
English regardless of current locale). Real capture proves this region's
hash, and concrete pixel byte values, differ between the English
(`currentLocale=0`) and qps-ploc checkpoints -- e.g. a dark-ink byte in
English becomes a light-background/white byte in qps-ploc at the same
screen coordinate -- real, screen-region/pixel-level proof the qps-ploc
decoration marker (`scripts/localization/pseudo.py`'s deterministic
`"Back"` -> `"[[BaaCk]]"` transform) is visible and differs from English.
See `tools/gba-playtest/backend.c`/`gba_playtest.py`'s new plan-format-v3
`regions`/`pixel_probes` checkpoint fields and their mandatory host schema
tests, `tools/gba-playtest/tests/test_region_pixel_schema.py` (32 tests)
and `tools/gba-playtest/tests/region_hash_mirror.py`.

**Soft-reboot persistence (implemented, sprint 5)**: a prior sprint's
fresh-cold-boot-from-fixture proof (semantically related but not a
literal reboot) has been superseded -- `locale-softreset-persistence-
multi-modern-debug` now replays the real first-run-selector input
choosing `qps-ploc`, then holds the actual GBA hardware soft-reset key
combo (`A+B+SELECT+START`, ~20-24 frames). libmGBA's default HLE BIOS
implements this combo without any custom backend/game code, producing a
genuine full reboot (fresh EWRAM/BSS -- `startupRunCount` resets to `0`)
while the underlying SRAM image is never swapped/replaced. Post-reboot,
the selector does not reappear and `currentLocale` reads back `qps-ploc`
without re-selection -- real persistence across a real reboot on
continuous SRAM, not a fixture stand-in.

**Real Config settings-submenu live navigation (implemented, sprint 5)**:
a prior sprint's inconclusive live-navigation investigation has been
superseded -- `locale-settings-real-navigation-multi-modern-debug` drives
the actual reachable in-game path (Prep Map -> `Options` -> Configuration
screen -> `Language` row -> `RIGHT`) entirely through replayed controller
input, never calling `ExpansionLanguageMenu_OpenSettings()` directly and
never substituting a fixture for the entry point. Real probe evidence:
`settingsActive` toggles 0->1 on real entry; selecting `qps-ploc` moves
`currentLocale`/`cacheGeneration`/`settingsChangeCount` and auto-closes
the submenu; reopening the submenu and pressing `B` (Back, no selection)
leaves `currentLocale`/`cacheGeneration`/`settingsChangeCount` and all 6
persisted `ExpansionUserPrefs` SRAM bytes byte-identical while
`settingsOpenCount` still increments -- real, capture-verified proof that
Back never mutates prefs.

Debug/release matrix: every scenario with cross-config relevance ships
both a `-modern-debug` and `-modern-release` pair (7 of 10 file pairs);
the three prefs no-wipe scenarios are debug-only, since the classification
logic they exercise (`ExpansionUserPrefs_Normalize`) has no config-
dependent branch and Sprint 3's host tests already prove config-
independence at the pure-function level. The multi-locale config is built
as an entirely separate ROM (own build root
`build/expansion-modern-multi`, own `ExpansionMetadata`/fingerprints) via
`EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES=en,qps-ploc EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE=1` --
**qps-ploc is never conflated with a real translation or with the
single-locale build's own budget/metadata numbers.**

### 4. New Make targets + `expansion-modern-linker-check` wiring

`modern.mk` adds:

- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-debug-check`
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-release-check`
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check`
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-prefs-check`
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-save-check`
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-shifted-check`

All six (plus the pre-existing `expansion-modern-localization-budget-
check`) are now dependencies of `expansion-modern-linker-check`, so the
existing upstream CI/verify path (which already invokes that target)
picks these six runtime-check targets up automatically -- no `build.yml`
change was needed for *this* wiring specifically, since
`expansion-modern-linker-check` was already a CI/verify gate before this
sprint.

That said, this branch's merge history (`14df9ec3`, merging
`origin/master` in) does contain a separate, explicitly-authorized,
purely additive edit to `.github/workflows/build.yml`: a new
`localization-host-suite` step (`Run localization host test suite (issue
#18)`) appended to the host-tests job, running
`scripts/localization/tests`' own pure-stdlib suite
(`python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/localization/tests -p
"test_*.py"`). It only appends a new step -- no existing `build.yml` step
was modified, reordered, or removed, and no gate was weakened. The
matching `verify.py`/`verify --dry-run` gate and
`docs/upstream-porting.md` gate list were updated in the same commit so
CI and the local `verify` mirror stay in lockstep (see that commit's
message and `git diff master...HEAD -- .github/workflows/build.yml` for
one additive localization-host-suite step; no existing step modified/reordered/removed).

**Shifted-layout check**: `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-shifted-
check` reruns `blank-sram-no-selector-default` and `auto-select-single-
locale` through `scripts/shiftcheck/modern_shifted_boot.sh` under a
`__text_shift=0x40000` relink, proving the locale resolver/selector-probe
scenarios are unaffected by build-address shifting (no hardcoded/absolute-
address dependency introduced by this feature).

### 5. Budget/headroom -- real, non-hardcoded

`scripts/linker_report/localization_budget.py` (new) +
`reports/linker-budget/modern-localization-{debug,release}.json`:

- `rom_catalog_index` / `rom_catalog_strings`: real `nm -S` sizes for the
  generated catalog/index ROM symbols (`gExpansionLocaleMsgIds`,
  `gExpansionLocaleMsgCount`, `gExpansionLocaleTombstoneCount`,
  `gExpansionCatalog_en`, `gExpansionCatalog_qps_ploc`).
- `ewram_ui_state` / `ewram_resolver_state`: real `nm -S` sizes for
  `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` and the resolver's EWRAM state/cache
  symbols (`sCurrentLocale`, `sCurrentLocaleValid`, `sCacheLocale`,
  `sCacheMsgId`, `sCacheValid`, `sScratch`).
- `source_catalog_budget`: source-side string/index/decoded-max/glyph
  usage from `scripts/localization/generate.py`, independent of any
  particular linked ROM.
- `regions_headroom`: `rom`/`ewram`/`iwram` `capacity_bytes`/
  `occupied_bytes`/`free_bytes`/`overflow`, computed from the **real**
  linker `.map` for this exact build (floating `.data`/`.bss` tail up to
  `__floating_end` through whatever pinned symbol follows it). `--check`
  fails only on a real map-reported `overflow: true` -- **no fixed byte
  threshold, and specifically no hardcoded "2820"/"3508" research-note
  number, gates pass/fail anywhere in this tool.**

Both debug and release reports were regenerated this sprint via real
`make expansion-modern-localization-budget-check` runs and pass.

### 6. Real clean builds + captures; drift audit

Debug, release, and the `en,qps-ploc` multi-locale config were all built
via real `arm-none-eabi-gcc` (`MODERN_CONFIG=debug|release`, plus the
separate multi-locale build root) and exercised through the real libmGBA
backend (`libmgba-dev 0.10.2`) for every capture/verify in this report --
no fingerprint in this diff was hand-written. All 12 locale-* scenario/
fingerprint pairs, plus every pre-existing fingerprint this sprint's own
`src/expansion_locale.c` EWRAM fix legitimately drifted, were captured via
`gba_playtest.py capture` and confirmed via `verify --policy behavior`.
Diffs to existing fingerprints touch only the fields the drift actually
changed (SRAM/framebuffer hashes, probe values); no pointer-allowlist
entry, baseline, or TAS file was touched.

**Pre-existing fingerprints this sprint regenerated** (all root-caused to
the EWRAM fix, none fabricated -- see "Bugs found and fixed" below):
`debugtools-hub-modern-debug`, `debugtools-ch4-prep-launch-modern-debug`,
and all 9 `savecompat-*-modern-release` scenarios (`current`,
6x`dialog-back-*`, `erase`, `current-migrated`).

### 7. Host suite / gate results

- **`python3 -m pytest -q --ignore=tests/upstream_port
  --ignore=scripts/texttools/huffman_test.py`: 1372 passed, 5 skipped, 78
  subtests passed** (720s). Both excludes are **pre-existing, unrelated**
  collection errors confirmed present at base commit `92ed1b6b` (`tests/
  upstream_port/*` do `from tests.upstream_port import helpers as h`,
  which fails because `tests/__init__.py` does not exist -- a pre-existing
  package-layout inconsistency, last touched by unrelated commit
  `c74f48e0`; `scripts/texttools/huffman_test.py` similarly). Neither
  `--import-mode=importlib` nor `PYTHONPATH=.` resolves this pre-existing
  issue; it is out of this sprint's file-domain scope to fix (tests/
  modification is not authorized here). **1372 >> the 266-test contract
  floor.**
- `python3 -m pytest -q tools/gba-playtest/tests`: **286 passed, 4
  skipped, 43 subtests passed** (135s) -- includes the new
  `test_locale_probe_schema.py`.
- `make expansion-modern-linker-check MODERN_CONFIG=debug` (sequential, no
  `-j`): **passes completely, no failures.**
- `make expansion-modern-linker-check MODERN_CONFIG=release` (sequential,
  no `-j`): **passes completely, no failures.**
- `python3 scripts/artifact_guard.py --revision HEAD` (unchanged tool):
  no tracked ROM/save/savestate/build output introduced by this sprint's
  diff.
- `scripts/shiftcheck/scan_build_addrs.py` / `scan_raw_casts.sh`
  (unchanged tools, already inside `expansion-modern-linker-check`): clean.

## Bugs found and fixed this sprint

Musk-Algorithm discipline: every one of these was root-caused to an
underlying real defect before being fixed -- none were "worked around" by
editing a fingerprint/baseline/test to hide the symptom.

1. **`MODERN_GOALS` allowlist gap (Makefile correctness bug).**
   `modern.mk`'s `MODERN_GOALS` is a fixed allowlist gating whether the
   `git rev-parse HEAD`-based config-resolution/`-D`-define pipeline runs
   at all for a given `make` invocation. The six new runtime-check target
   names were initially missing from it, so the pipeline silently no-op'd
   and the compiled ROM embedded a hardcoded `"unknown"` `build_commit`
   sentinel, failing `verify_rom_header.py`'s embedded-vs-metadata
   comparison. Root-caused via the pre-existing `print-%` debug target
   (`make print-MODERN_BUILD_COMMIT`); an initial "transient git race"
   hypothesis was a red herring. **Fixed** by adding all eight new target
   names to `MODERN_GOALS`.
2. **`modern_shifted_boot.sh` had no way to supply a non-default SRAM
   fixture.** Its `verify_scenario()` always called `gba_playtest.py
   verify` with no `--sram-image`, silently using blank/default SRAM
   regardless of what a given scenario actually needed --
   `locale-auto-select-single-locale` requires the `UNSET`-prefs fixture,
   not blank SRAM, and initially failed the shifted-check with
   blank-SRAM-shaped probe values. **Fixed** via an optional,
   backward-compatible `SHIFTCHECK_SRAM_IMAGE` env var (empty by default,
   a no-op for every pre-existing caller).
3. **Two debug fingerprints drifted by the EWRAM fix were initially
   regenerated incorrectly** (`debugtools-hub-modern-debug`,
   `debugtools-ch4-prep-launch-modern-debug`): an ad-hoc regeneration
   omitted the `--sram-image build/.../debugtools-fixtures/debugtools-
   current.sav` argument the real Make recipe always passes, so the
   "passing in isolation" fingerprint failed again once exercised through
   the actual Make target. **Fixed** by regenerating with the exact
   Make-recipe arguments; lesson generalized into "always inspect the
   real recipe's arguments before any ad-hoc fingerprint regeneration."
4. **Nine release `savecompat-*` fingerprints were never regenerated** in
   the prior session's debug-only EWRAM-fix fixup pass, and were caught
   by this sprint's full-release-gate run. **Fixed** via a script exactly
   replicating `run_save_compat_checks.py`'s fixture/scenario/fingerprint-
   name conventions; verified by re-running that script directly for
   `--config release`.
5. **The prefs-safety "no-wipe" SRAM-hash discrepancy** (root cause: an
   entirely vanilla, locale-unrelated `struct SoundRoomSaveData` at SRAM
   offset `0x7224` legitimately rewrites 2 of its own bytes on every
   boot). Root-caused via a full, chunked (1024-byte-limited) byte-by-byte
   SRAM diff across the entire 0x8000-byte image, not just the meta
   struct region initially suspected. **Fixed** (not worked around) by
   adding this pre-existing, unrelated struct's real address range to
   `sram_hash_exclude_ranges` alongside the already-expected
   `ExpansionUserPrefs` record, with an honest scenario description
   documenting why.
6. **`-j$(nproc)` parallel runs of the full `expansion-modern-linker-
   check` gate produced spurious, non-reproducible failures** that never
   reproduced sequentially -- a real hazard in a complex dependency graph
   with several sub-`$(MAKE)` invocations (the multi-locale build) sharing
   `expansion-modern-rom`/`expansion-modern-elf` prerequisites.
   **Mitigated** by documenting (here and in `docs/localization.md`) that
   the full gate must always be verified sequentially; not fixed at the
   Makefile-dependency-graph level (out of scope for this sprint -- no
   scenario/fingerprint/target correctness was affected, only spurious
   `-j` noise).

None of these required editing `src/`/`include/` UI logic beyond the
already-landed EWRAM fix (from a prior session, retained unmodified this
sprint) -- every fix this sprint is confined to `modern.mk`, `scripts/
shiftcheck/modern_shifted_boot.sh`, scenario/fingerprint JSON, and this
sprint's own new files.

## Historical scope items now closed

Real Config navigation, visible pseudo-marker proof, literal soft-reset
persistence, the exact documentation inventory, and the external-link
registry are all present and checked in the final tree. The historical
candidate's earlier descoping/non-applicability wording is superseded.

## WHERE / DON'T compliance

- No edits to `baseline.json`, any TAS file, the pointer allowlist,
  content assets, vanilla message tables, `GetLang`/`SetLang`/
  `gLanguageMode`, or XMAP region/magic definitions. `.github/workflows/
  build.yml` *was* edited on this branch (see "New Make targets" above)
  -- one explicitly-authorized, purely additive `localization-host-suite`
  step, with the matching `verify.py` gate and doc update in the same
  commit; no existing CI gate was weakened, reordered, or removed.
- No runtime/content semantics are inferred from documentation. Translation
  inputs remain the pinned, reviewed sources documented in
  `docs/game_locale_sources.md`; the final generated reports bind their exact
  hashes and providers.
- Every fingerprint touched in this diff is a real, capture-verified
  regeneration (see WHAT #6); none were hand-edited.
- `git log` shows no `--amend`/force-push in this sprint's history; this
  commit is a plain, ordinary append to `agent/issue18-localization`.
- Remote issue state is outside this branch-local evidence report.

## Addendum: issue #18 sprint 6 -- two runtime blockers fixed on top of cap self-heal

The detailed sprint 4/5 sections remain historical evidence; this addendum
records the sprint 6 correction to the one earlier claim that sprint 6
falsified, plus the two runtime blockers actually fixed:

1. **Fresh-metadata over-eager VALID stamp (multi-locale first-start
   prompt suppression).** `src/bmsave-lib.c`'s
   `BuildCurrentExpansionSaveMeta()` unconditionally stamped a
   syntactically VALID, already-selected-default `ExpansionUserPrefs`
   record into fresh/blank SRAM metadata regardless of how many locales a
   build had enabled. On a single-enabled-locale build this is correct
   (nothing to prompt for); on a multi-locale build it silently skipped
   the mandatory blocking first-start locale prompt every single boot,
   because the very first `ExpansionUserPrefs_Load()` this sprint's own
   selector performs already saw a VALID record. Fixed by gating that
   stamp on `FE8_EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALE_COUNT <= 1`
   (`include/expansion_config.h`); a multi-locale build's fresh save now
   leaves the record canonically UNSET, and the selector correctly shows.
   This directly falsifies this report's own table row above (previously
   `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-multi`, corrected in place; see also
   `docs/localization.md`).

2. **Fallback-as-selection (`RowSelected` skip-on-current-equals-chosen).**
   `ExpansionLanguageMenu_RuntimeInit`'s `EXPANSION_LANGUAGE_STARTUP_
   SHOW_MENU` path leaves `ExpansionLocale_GetCurrent()` at its runtime
   fallback/default value purely so the selector has something to render
   -- it never itself persists anything. `ExpansionLanguageMenu_
   RowSelected` only wrote a new record when the chosen row's locale
   differed from that fallback value, so choosing the row that happened
   to match the fallback (extremely likely, since the fallback *is* the
   build-configured default) looked exactly like a redundant no-op
   reselection and silently left a corrupt/unset/unknown-locale/disabled-
   locale on-disk record unrepaired forever, re-prompting on every future
   boot even after the player had "chosen" a locale. Fixed by adding an
   explicit `needsPreferenceRepair` probe/runtime flag
   (`include/expansion_language_menu.h`, appended -- never inserted --
   after every pre-sprint-6 field), set unconditionally from
   `ExpansionUserPrefs_Normalize()`'s own `requiresPrompt` output at
   startup and cleared only by a verified-successful `ExpansionUserPrefs_
   Store()`; `RowSelected` now commits when `locale != previous` **or**
   this flag is still set (gated on the selector's own `active` probe, so
   the independent settings submenu's unconditional same-locale no-op
   contract is unaffected).

Both fixes are covered by new host structural tests
(`tools/gba-playtest/tests/test_expansion_language_menu.py`'s
`RowSelectedPreferenceRepairStructureTests`, `test_locale_probe_schema.py`'s
updated field/offset table) and by real libmGBA debug+release captures:
the renamed `locale-blank-sram-selector-multi-modern-{debug,release}`
pair (superseding the deleted `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-multi-
modern-{debug,release}` pair, which had encoded the bug itself as
"expected"), and a regenerated fingerprint for `locale-settings-real-
navigation-multi-modern-debug` (now booted from an explicit
`valid_explicit_en.sav` post-first-boot fixture instead of blank SRAM,
since blank SRAM on this same two-locale build now correctly shows the
first-start selector too and would otherwise consume that scenario's own
hardcoded early input timeline -- that scenario's real subject is
Settings-submenu reachability, not first-start-prompt reachability, which
is what the renamed scenario now covers on its own). All six
`expansion-modern-localization-runtime-*-check` targets (prefs, save,
shifted, debug, release, multi -- both configs where applicable) were
rerun end-to-end after these fixes and pass.

## Addendum: issue #18 sprint 7 -- real multi-locale repair matrix (UNSET/CORRUPT/UNKNOWN/DISABLED x debug/release)

Sprint 6 above fixed the two runtime blockers that let a real
multi-locale first-start prompt/repair be shown and committed at all.
It did not, however, add scenario coverage that actually *drives* that
real prompt for the CORRUPT/UNKNOWN_LOCALE/DISABLED_LOCALE/UNSET
sub-states: the three `-no-wipe-modern-debug` scenarios (table above,
sprint 4) still only run against the **single-locale** build, where the
same repair path silently collapses to `AUTO_SELECT` because there is
nothing to prompt over. This addendum closes that specific gap with a
genuine 4 (prefs sub-state) x 2 (`MODERN_CONFIG`) = 8-scenario matrix,
named `locale-repair-<state>-multi-modern-{debug,release}`:

| Scenario | Config | Proves |
|---|---|---|
| `locale-repair-unset-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | debug, release | Blank/`UNSET` `ExpansionUserPrefs` on the `en,qps-ploc` build: real blocking selector shown (`active=1`, `autoSelected=0`, `needsPreferenceRepair=1`, `promptReason=UNSET`), explicit navigate-away-and-back-to-`en` choice, `Store()` fires, whole-SRAM no-wipe, real `A+B+SELECT+START` soft reset, `prefsState=VALID` + selector suppressed on reboot. |
| `locale-repair-corrupt-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | debug, release | Same real prompt/choose-default/no-wipe/reboot proof for a `CORRUPT` record (bad checksum). |
| `locale-repair-unknown-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | debug, release | Same, for an `UNKNOWN_LOCALE` record (a syntactically valid but out-of-range locale id). |
| `locale-repair-disabled-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | debug, release | Same, for a `DISABLED_LOCALE` record naming `ja` (locale id 1) -- a real, in-range `ExpansionLocaleId` that this multi-locale build genuinely does not enable (unlike the single-locale no-wipe fixture's own disabled id, 7/`qps-ploc`, which IS enabled here and therefore can no longer name a disabled locale on this build). A new fixture, `disabled_on_multi.sav`, was added to `modern.mk` for exactly this reason. |

All 8 are real libmGBA captures (never host-only input replay), matched
by real `tools/gba-playtest/fingerprints/locale-repair-*.json` files and
independently re-verified via `gba_playtest.py verify --policy behavior`
(7 checkpoints each, zero mismatches). The release half of the matrix is
mandatory, not skipped: unlike the sprint-4 no-wipe trio (debug-only,
justified there by `ExpansionUserPrefs_Normalize`'s config-independence
at the pure-function level), this matrix's whole point is to prove the
*runtime UI* path end-to-end, which is exactly the kind of behavior a
debug-only check cannot stand in for.

**Why "choose the default" is non-trivial evidence, not busywork**: every
scenario explicitly navigates the cursor away from `en` (down to
`qps-ploc`) and back before confirming `en` -- proving a real cursor
round-trip (framebuffer-hash self-check between the original prompt
checkpoint and the post-round-trip checkpoint) rather than a single
scripted keypress that happens to land on row 0. Confirming the row that
already equals the runtime's own current fallback value is exactly the
case the sprint-6 `mustRepair` fix in `ExpansionLanguageMenu_RowSelected`
(`src/expansion_language_menu.c`) exists for: without it, this exact
input sequence would look like a redundant no-op reselection and the
corrupt/unset/unknown/disabled record would never actually be repaired.

**Modern.mk wiring**: `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check`
gained the 3 new fixture prerequisites (`corrupt.sav`, `unknown.sav`,
`disabled_on_multi.sav` -- `unset.sav` was already a prerequisite) and 4
new `verify` invocations, wired **unconditionally** (both
`MODERN_CONFIG=debug` and `=release`, never inside the `ifeq
($(MODERN_CONFIG),debug)` guard that scopes the pre-existing debug-only
scenarios in this same target). Both configs were rerun end-to-end for
real (`make expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check
MODERN_CONFIG={debug,release} ...`) and pass, including every
pre-existing scenario in the target alongside the 4 new ones per config.
The pre-existing `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-prefs-check`
target (the three single-locale/debug-only no-wipe scenarios) is
unchanged and remains in the gate on its own honest merits; its
docstring/comment in `modern.mk` was updated to state plainly that it is
not, and never was, a substitute for this matrix.

**New host tests**: `scripts/modernize/tests/
test_modern_localization_header_bootstrap.py`'s
`ModernLocalizationRepairMatrixTests` statically enumerates the exact
4x2 matrix and fails if: any of the 8 scenario/fingerprint file pairs is
missing (including a release pair); any scenario's prompt checkpoint
lacks the real blocking-selector invariants or ever encodes
`autoSelected=1` (i.e. silently regresses to `AUTO_SELECT`); the required
checkpoint sequence or the literal `A+B+SELECT+START` soft-reset input is
missing; the commit/final checkpoints don't prove `Store()`-fired/
no-wipe/`VALID`-after-reboot; the fixture mapping (including
`disabled_on_multi.sav`'s `--disabled-locale-id 1`) is wrong; or
`modern.mk` fails to wire all 8 pairs into
`expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check` unconditionally.
Mutation-tested during development (deleting a release scenario file,
and flipping an `autoSelected` expected value) to confirm each failure
mode is actually caught, not merely a vacuously-passing assertion.

`docs/localization.md` gained a matching scenario-table row and a new
"The real multi-locale repair matrix (issue #18 sprint 7)" subsection
with the same checkpoint-by-checkpoint evidence summary.

## Addendum: issue #18 runtime byte-consumer closure

The final runtime slice removes the remaining modern-CJK byte/fixed-pair
walkers from `msg.c`, `scene.c`, `cgtext.c`, and `helpbox.c`, plus the
tightly-coupled subtitle rewind in `bb.c`. `TextUtf8_Next` now owns FE
stream tokenization for low controls, three-byte `[LoadFace]+FID`, extended
controls and color arguments, U+3000/legacy spacing, strict UTF-8, and
invalid/truncated input. Legacy/English-only preprocessing retains the old
walkers and layouts.

`StringInsertSpecialPrefixByCtrl` and `StrInsertTact` now preserve control
tokens while inserting UTF-8 tactician/item/character names with bounded
writes. They reuse `gBufPrep` transiently as a generated-capacity output
region plus disjoint `0x100` insertion scratch, then commit the result back
to the persistent localized message buffer; no full-message EWRAM scratch
was added. Unknown-size modern CJK
`GetStringFromIndexInBuffer` calls fail with `<!LOC_CAP!>`, and every
production caller was migrated to an explicit capacity. Audited safe
non-owned walkers are `SysboxTextMain`, `GetStringNextLine`,
`SplitObjectiveTextOnNewline`, and `CopyTextChar`: each starts at a renderer
returned token boundary and advances with `Text_DrawCharacter` or
`GetCharTextLen`; `CopyTextChar` has no production caller.
