A **Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones (GBA) expansion framework**, built and
released with a modern `arm-none-eabi` GCC/AAPCS toolchain. The expansion
ROM is built from source and is **not** required to be byte-identical to
the original game. The original agbcc-based decompilation build is kept as
an explicit, unbroken **archival** side lane for decomp-matching work — see
[`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md).

📚 **[Full documentation index](docs/README.md)** — start there for
architecture, support matrix, governance, and migration guides. The
**[project wiki](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion/wiki)**
is a concise navigation portal to those authoritative repository docs.

## Quick start

From the repo root, on Ubuntu/WSL, Arch Linux, or macOS/Homebrew, run:

```bash
./scripts/quickstart.sh [--rom /path/to/baserom.gba] [--legacy] [--refresh-agbcc]
```

By default this installs the modern toolchain, an ARM GDB debugger, the mGBA
GDB-server frontend, and the libmGBA playtest backend (**no agbcc of any
kind**), then builds and boot-verifies the **supported modern AAPCS release ROM**
(`build/expansion-modern/release/aapcs/fireemblem8.gba`). Pass `--legacy`
to build the archival agbcc-based `fireemblem8.gba` instead. The build does
**not** require the original ROM — a `baserom.gba` is only used by
`asmdiff.sh` for disassembly comparison.

See [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for full flags and
troubleshooting, and [`docs/framework-support.md`](docs/framework-support.md)
for the exact supported-host/toolchain/target matrix.


The default is English-only with all starter features off, so no configuration
step is required. For persistent opt-ins, use the GNU Autoconf front end:

```bash
./configure --enable-mechanics-hooks --enable-mechanics-sample
make
```

`configure` validates the complete profile and writes ignored
`config.autotools.mk`/`GNUmakefile` outputs; direct `make VAR=value` overrides
remain available for one-off builds. See
[`docs/config_identity.md`](docs/config_identity.md),
[`docs/starter_features.md`](docs/starter_features.md), and
[`docs/localization.md`](docs/localization.md) before enabling optional
content or locales.

## Default build behavior

A bare `make` (or `make all`) deterministically builds and boot-verifies
the modern release AAPCS ROM — it never requires, builds, or resolves to a
`tools/agbcc` executable or library:

```bash
make                # equivalent to: make all
```

Equivalently, and explicitly:

```bash
make expansion-modern-toolchain-check
make expansion-modern-boot-check MODERN_CONFIG=release MODERN_ABI=aapcs -j$(nproc)
```

To clean build artifacts: `make clean` (or `make clean_fast` to skip the
slow battle-animation compression outputs).

The repository-only path is therefore: quickstart -> configure -> author
JSON/content and locale catalogs -> build -> run host and ROM gates -> debug
with the bounded debug-tools and libmGBA scenario harness. The project wiki is
optional navigation; no wiki is required for that path.
