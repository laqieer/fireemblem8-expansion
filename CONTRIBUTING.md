# Contributing to Fire Emblem 8 Expansion

This project's default, supported contribution path is the **modern
`arm-none-eabi` GCC/AAPCS framework**. The original agbcc-based
decompilation workflow is preserved as an explicit **archival** lane — see
the "Archival/decomp contributions" section at the end of this document
and [`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md) for its full
guide.

For architecture context before you dive in, see
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) and the
[full documentation index](docs/README.md).

## 1. Preparation

1. Register an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.
2. Fork and clone the repository, then fetch submodules:
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
3. Run the quickstart to get a working modern build:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/quickstart.sh
   ```
   See [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) for flags and
   troubleshooting, and [`docs/framework-support.md`](docs/framework-support.md)
   for supported hosts/toolchains.
4. Review `config.mk` and [`docs/config_identity.md`](docs/config_identity.md).
   Defaults are English-only and all issue #6 starter flags are off; opt-ins
   are explicit build inputs, not source edits.

## 2. Choose your change type

| Change type | Where | Primary commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Content authoring** (characters, classes, items, supports, Chapter 2 slice) | `src/data/*.json` | `make generated-data-validate`, `make generated-data-generate`, `make generated-data-test` — see [`docs/generated_data_tutorial.md`](docs/generated_data_tutorial.md) |
| **Starter content/mechanics/QoL** | `src/data/items_expansion.json`, typed callbacks under `src/`/`include/` | See the dependency-safe profiles and matrices in [`docs/starter_features.md`](docs/starter_features.md) |
| **Localization** | `texts/expansion/registry.json`, `texts/expansion/catalog.<locale>.json` | `make localization-validate`, `make localization-generate`, `make localization-test` — see [`docs/localization.md`](docs/localization.md) |
| **C/runtime code** (modern framework) | `src/`, `include/` | `make expansion-modern-toolchain-check`, `make expansion-modern-cohort` (or `-all`), `make expansion-modern-elf`, `make expansion-modern-rom`, `make expansion-modern-boot-check` — see [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) |
| **Docs** | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/*.md` | Verify every relative link resolves and every referenced command actually exists |
| **Upstream-port tracking** | `config/upstream-port-state.json` (via CLI only) | `python3 -m scripts.upstream_port scan/drift/report/update-state/verify` — see [`docs/upstream-porting.md`](docs/upstream-porting.md) |
| **Archival/decomp matching** | `asm/`, `src/` (agbcc-matched) | `make legacy` — see [`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md) |

## 3. Fast checks (no ROM, run these first)

```bash
python3 scripts/artifact_guard.py --revision HEAD
make generated-data-validate
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/artifact_guard_tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/modernize/tests -v          # modern build/config/save-format host tests
GBA_PLAYTEST_HOST_ONLY=1 python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/gba-playtest/tests -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/localization/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/docs_check_tests -v
python3 scripts/check_docs.py --check --check-examples
python3 -m scripts.upstream_port scan                               # only if your change touches upstream-port tracking
```

`scripts/modernize/tests` and `tools/gba-playtest/tests` assume
`./build_tools.sh` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` have
already been run (quickstart does both); a small number of their host
tests are environment-dependent (missing built tool binaries, or a
libmGBA backend without `pkg-config` metadata) and fail actionably rather
than silently in an incomplete environment — see each test's own
diagnostic.

## 4. Full validation policy

During iteration, run only the focused fast checks and the one relevant ROM
profile for the code you changed. Do not repeatedly run every host suite plus
both linker configurations locally: the dispatch-only
`.github/workflows/full-matrix.yml` workflow exists to parallelize that broad
evidence pass once for the exact branch/SHA before merge. It supplements the
existing required Build CI workflow and does not weaken or replace any
push/pull-request gate.

After pushing the candidate branch, dispatch and watch it with:

```bash
gh workflow run full-matrix.yml --ref <branch>
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
```

The run summary records `github.sha`, `github.ref`, and fail-closed conclusions
for the host, modern debug/release matrix, archival legacy, and release-evidence
lanes. `gh run watch ... --exit-status` must finish successfully before merge.
The modern matrix invokes only the canonical
`expansion-modern-linker-check`; that target already owns its CJK profile,
runtime, shifted-link, and linker-budget dependencies.

The fixed upstream-port verifier still lists the current-master Build CI
commands with `python3 -m scripts.upstream_port verify --dry-run --jobs 2`.
If your change can affect boot, save, or gameplay behavior, also capture
`tools/gba-playtest` scenario evidence (scenario, environment, command,
result) — see [`docs/issue-resolution-policy.md`](docs/issue-resolution-policy.md#issue-closure-evidence).


## 5. Debug before filing a regression

Use [`docs/debugtools.md`](docs/debugtools.md) for the release-safe debug
surface and [`tools/gba-playtest/README.md`](tools/gba-playtest/README.md)
for deterministic scenario/fingerprint diagnosis. Do not refresh a reviewed
fingerprint merely to make a mismatch disappear; preserve the failing output,
root-cause it, and document any justified oracle change.

## 6. PR provenance and review

This repository's Wave 0 governance baseline is the single authoritative
source for what a PR/issue must record before closure:
[`docs/issue-resolution-policy.md`](docs/issue-resolution-policy.md). In
short:

- Issue closure is a human decision backed by plain-prose evidence in the
  PR/issue thread (frozen scope, every command run and its result,
  runtime/playtest evidence when relevant) — not a machine-readable schema.
- Use [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)'s
  checklist shape.
- `reports/baseline/`, `tools/gba-playtest/fingerprints/`, and
  `scripts/shiftcheck/tas/fingerprint.lua` are reviewed oracles — explain
  *why* in your PR description if you touch them.
- `python3 scripts/artifact_guard.py --revision HEAD` rejects tracked
  ROM/ELF/save/savestate/patch/generated-compressed-asset files; it is a
  structural check, **not** a legal/copyright clearance — see
  [`docs/project-governance.md`](docs/project-governance.md#copyright-and-provenance).

## Archival/decomp contributions

If your change is byte-for-byte decomp-matching work against the original
ROM (not the supported modern framework), use the archival agbcc lane:

```bash
make legacy -j$(nproc)
```

The full decompiling tutorial, rules, setup steps, and related
asset-extraction references live in
[`docs/archival-decomp.md`](docs/archival-decomp.md) — that document is
explicitly marked unsupported for expansion releases; do not treat it as
guidance for the default framework path.
