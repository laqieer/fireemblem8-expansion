# Standalone targets for scripts/release_rehearsal + scripts/modernize/migrations
# (issue #9 -- read-only release/publication rehearsal).
#
# None of these targets are wired into `all`, `expansion-modern-*`, or any
# existing host/build/generated/upstream/default/runtime gate; they are
# fully standalone, exactly like generated-data-check (generated_data.mk).
# See docs/release_process.md for the full contract, including the exit
# code contract the underlying CLI itself defines (0/1/2/3 -- see
# scripts/release_rehearsal/cli.py's own module docstring for the exact
# meaning of each code).
#
# IMPORTANT -- Make does not preserve/forward that granular exit code.
# That 0/1/2/3 contract belongs to a *direct* CLI invocation (e.g.
# `python3 -m scripts.release_rehearsal.cli check --require-eligible`).
# GNU Make itself, when any recipe in a target exits non-zero, always
# reports the *target*'s own exit status as exit code 2 (a fixed "Error
# N" message is printed naming the recipe's real code, but `make`'s own
# process exit status to its caller is 2 regardless of whether the
# recipe actually exited 1, 2, 3, or any other non-zero value --
# reproduce with e.g. `printf 't:\n\texit 1\n' | make -f - t; echo $?`,
# which prints `2`, never `1`). So every comment below that says a target
# "exits N" while invoked via `make <target>` means the *underlying CLI*
# exits N; `make <target>` itself only ever distinguishes exit 0 (the
# recipe succeeded) from exit 2 (the recipe failed for *some* reason --
# the granular 1-vs-2-vs-3 distinction is not visible at the `make`
# process-exit-status layer, only in the recipe's own stdout/stderr/JSON
# report). Invoke the CLI directly (never through `make`) when the exact
# 1-vs-3 distinction itself must be observed as a process exit code.

#                                    well-formed report (the report's own
#                                    "status" may say "blocked" -- expected
#                                    -- or "mechanically eligible").

#
# The two targets below are the machine-distinct status/exit-code gates
# (issue #9 verifier remediation) -- unlike the two targets above, THESE
# ARE INTENDED TO, AND CURRENTLY DO, FAIL (non-zero exit) while this
# repository's candidate is BLOCKED (its current, correct, expected
# state): they exist so a stricter pipeline stage (or a human) can demand
# "prove this is actually eligible" and get a real failure, instead of
# reading prose.

# release-check-require-eligible  : `cli check --require-eligible`.
#                                    The CLI itself exits 1 while
#                                    BLOCKED; `make` itself reports this
#                                    (like any failed recipe) as exit 2,
#                                    not 1 -- see the IMPORTANT note above.

#                                    contract as the target above.
#
# The two targets below are the complementary "expected-blocked health
# check" targets: the underlying CLI exits 0 ONLY if the candidate's
# status is exactly "blocked" (today's real, expected state) and exits 3
# the moment it ever stops being exactly that -- e.g. useful in CI to
# mechanically assert "still blocked, as expected" without ever papering
# over a status this repository has not been told (via a real, reviewed
# change to this Makefile/workflow) to expect instead. Through `make`,
# the healthy (still-blocked) case is exit 0 exactly as the CLI reports;
# the moment that ever stops being true, `make` itself reports exit 2
# (not 3) for the same reason as `*-require-eligible` above.

# implicitly fall back to a bare `git rev-parse HEAD` call. Locally, this

# behavior to before) -- but it is now an explicit, auditable value any
# caller can see/override, and CI (.github/workflows/release-rehearsal.yml)
# overrides it via a job-level `env: RELEASE_TARGET_SHA: ${{ github.sha }}`
# so the *exact, immutable checked-out commit* is what every eligibility
# check actually binds to, never an independently-resolved value that
