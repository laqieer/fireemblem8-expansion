# localization.mk -- fast, toolchain-independent developer/CI targets for
# the expansion localization catalog (issue #18 sprint 1).
#
# These targets only require Python (the stdlib-only scripts/localization
# package) -- never the modern GCC toolchain or legacy agbcc -- and never
# write anything outside build/ (see scripts/localization/generate.py's
# write-if-unchanged output and this repository's .gitignore). They are
# independent of (but consistent with) modern.mk's own "Localization
# catalog" section, which invokes the exact same generator as part of a
# real modern linked build; use these targets for a fast local/CI check
# without building the whole ROM.
#
# Included directly by the top-level Makefile, mirroring generated_data.mk's
# own standalone-fast-target convention (see that file/docs/generated_data.md).
