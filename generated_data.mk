# section. Batch 2c is closing that gap, one table at a time.
#
# GENERATED_DATA_LINKED_HAND_SOURCES is the single source of truth: every
# hand-written src/ C file listed here has its object filtered out of both
# the legacy (top-level Makefile) and modern (modern.mk) object lists and
# replaced by its generated build/generated/data/ equivalent -- the real
# ROM (and the modern object cohort) links the generated table, not the
# hand-written one. The hand source itself is never edited or deleted: it
# stays in the repo purely as the schema/round-trip reference (see this
# table's own "schema" section in docs/generated_data.md) that
# `generated-data-check` keeps proving byte-for-byte identical against.
#
# Batch 2c-1 linked `classes`; Batch 2c-2 added `items` (the 206-record
# global gItemData[] table); Batch 2c-3 added `supports` (the 33-record
# SupportData_* table -- see below, `supports` is a *multi-symbol* table,
# unlike `classes`/`items`' single top-level array symbol); Batch 2c-4
# (this update) adds `characters` (the 256-record global gCharacterData[]
# table -- back to a single top-level array symbol, like `classes`/
# `items`). Extending this list to another table also requires defining
# that table's own GENERATED_DATA_CONFIG_INPUTS_<table> and
# GENERATED_DATA_LINKED_SYMBOL_<table> (both below), since the
# generator's non-JSON, non-script "config" inputs (live enum/struct-

# --- Issue #10 item ID cap: environment/config build input, not a file -----
# FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP selects the item ID cap (default 0xCD; >=0xCE opts the
# src/data/items_expansion.json overlay + include/constants/items_expansion.h
# enum into gItemData[]). Two staleness gaps this closes:
#   1. The overlay JSON + expansion header are real generator inputs, so a
#      change to either must regenerate the table -- added below.
#   2. FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP is an env/config value: flipping it changes no source
#      mtime, so a plain input-driven rule would hand back a stale table. The
#      cap stamp records the *resolved* cap using the same FORCE +
#      write-if-changed idiom as modern.mk's compile-settings stamp: its mtime
#      only advances on a genuine cap change, so opting into 0xCE..0xFF (or
#      back to 0xCD) regenerates the table with no clean, while a repeat build
#      at the same cap stays a no-op. An invalid cap (non-integer, negative,
#      >0xFF, ...) fails here, early, before any generation.
# Forward the FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP *make* variable (which already reflects a
# `make FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=... <goal>` command-line assignment overriding any
# ambient environment value -- GNU Make's highest-precedence origin) into
# the resolver's environment. Two facts force the escaping below:
#   1. GNU Make (4.3) does NOT export makefile/command-line variables into a
#      $(shell) subprocess (the `export` directive only reaches recipe and
#      sub-make environments), and a `make FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=...` command-line
#      assignment is not in make's own process environment. So the resolver
#      cannot merely inherit the value -- it must be passed on the command.
#   2. Interpolating the *raw* value straight into the shell command is a
#      shell-injection vector: a crafted FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP with a single-quote
#      breakout (e.g. `'; touch pwned; echo '`) would otherwise execute during
#      parse. So POSIX-single-quote-escape it first -- wrap in single quotes
#      and rewrite every embedded ' as '\'' -- yielding one literal shell word
#      that can never be executed. (A value containing make-function syntax
#      like $(...) is still expanded by make itself when it evaluates the
#      user's own command line; that is inherent GNU Make behaviour, upstream
#      of this file, and is not a shell escape out of the resolver.)
# Empty (unset) forwards FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP='' -> default 0xCD.

# --- Issue #10 archival lane guard: item expansion is modern-only ----------
# Strategic binding decision: the archival agbcc lane is unsupported for item
# ID expansion. Its agbcc compile commands deliberately do NOT thread
# -DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP (only modern.mk's MODERN_DEFINE_FLAGS does), so at a
# non-vanilla cap the generator would plan a 0xCE..0xFF (up to 207-record)
# gItemData[] table while every archival object still compiles
# include/id_space.h's built-in ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP at the vanilla 0xCD --
# a silent generated-vs-compiled contract divergence.
#
# This guard is deliberately NOT a fragile literal MAKECMDGOALS whitelist (the
# prior approach only caught four hand-listed goal spellings and silently let
# every indirect archival entry -- fireemblem8_relocs.elf, the whole
# shiftcheck{,-static,-offsets,-diff,-run} family, objects.lst, direct object
# builds, and any future target that reaches the archival objects -- through at
# an expanded cap under `make -n`). Instead the cap assertion is bound to the
# real archival dependency-graph boundary: generated_data.mk defines a single
# .PHONY guard target here, and the Makefile attaches it (order-only) to the
# archival objects/link products (see "archival item-cap guard" there). So
# *any* target that reaches the agbcc archival objects/link -- named, indirect,
# or added later -- automatically inherits the guard through the graph, with no
# list to keep in sync.
#
# Mechanism: the guard's cap assertion lives in its *recipe* as a make $(error)
# function, which make expands (and thus fires) whenever the guard target is
# pulled into the active build graph -- including under `make -n` (a dry run
# still expands recipe text) and even when the archival products are already up
# to date (the guard is .PHONY, so it is always reconsidered). It is lazy: the
# recipe is only expanded when an archival target is actually requested, so the
# bare/default modern lane, the modern targets, and the standalone
# generated-data checks (which never depend on the archival objects/link) stay
# allowed at an expanded cap. The order-only attachment means the guard never
# forces an archival relink at the vanilla cap. The comparison uses the
# normalized, validated resolved caps (resolve_item_id_cap / ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP,
# both formatted 0x%02X), so any legal equivalent spelling of the vanilla cap
# (e.g. 205, 0xcd, 0o315) is accepted and any expanded value rejected -- no
# fragile raw-string compare. FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP is read from the environment and
# from a `make FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=... <goal>` command-line assignment (command
# line wins, GNU Make's highest-precedence origin).
GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP := $(shell $(PYTHON) -c "import scripts.generated_data.idspace as i; print('0x%02X' % i.ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP)" 2>/dev/null)

# (normalized compare, so 0xCD == 205 == 0o315 all read as vanilla / empty).
GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_CAP_EXPANDED := $(filter-out $(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP),$(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_CAP))
# The dependency-graph guard target. Empty recipe (`:`) at the vanilla cap;
# a fatal, actionable $(error) at an expanded cap. Because the assertion is a
# make function in the recipe body, it fires at plan/expansion time -- so
# `make -n <any archival goal>` exits non-zero -- before any archival compile
# or link (and before mgfembp's $(MAKE) sub-build) runs.
# --- Issue #10 archival item-cap guard: single actionable diagnostic ------
# One source of truth for the cap-divergence message, reused by BOTH gates:
#   1. the parse-time known-goal fast-fail (Makefile, fires before any recipe
#      / $(MAKE) -C mgfembp sub-build / agbcc compile), and
#   2. the dependency-graph backstop recipe below (catches unknown / indirect
#      / future archival entries).
# := so it captures the already-resolved, normalized caps once as static
# text; the embedded '(' / ')' / ',' only appear post-expansion, so wrapping
# it in $(error $(...)) is paren/comma-safe.
GENERATED_DATA_ARCHIVAL_ITEM_CAP_DIAG := Archival lane (the agbcc fireemblem8.gba/.elf/.map ROM/ELF/MAP, the `legacy` alias, fireemblem8_relocs.elf, the shiftcheck family, and objects.lst) only supports the vanilla item cap FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=$(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP), but FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP='$(FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP)' resolved to $(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_CAP). The agbcc archival lane does not thread -DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP, so an expanded cap would generate a table that diverges from the compiled ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP. Item ID expansion is modern-only: build the modern lane instead, e.g. `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=$(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_CAP) make expansion-modern-boot-check MODERN_CONFIG=release MODERN_ABI=aapcs`; or unset FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP (or set it to $(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP)) to build this archival target

# --- Issue #18: close the literal Make-DAG/state gap for the gate itself ---
# `generated-data-check` (the CI gate above) never referenced this stamp: its
# own recipe heals the ACTIVE surfaces + the items table via *direct* python
# calls (`idspace active-check`, `check --table items`), which are correct on
# their own merits -- both resolve THIS invocation's own env cap and rewrite
# write-if-changed, independent of the stamp's mtime -- but that means the
# gate's own recipe never touched the one real, Make-tracked file every other
# cap-aware target (the grouped ACTIVE_OUTPUTS rule, every linked table's .c
# rule) keys its own staleness on. That is a structural asymmetry between
# what the gate's recipe actually (already correctly) does and what the Make
# dependency graph believes happened -- "cap missing from Make DAG/state".
# Declaring the stamp as an ordinary prerequisite here closes that gap for
# good: `generated-data-check` now always reconciles the SAME stamp every
# other cap-aware rule relies on, so the graph and the on-disk cap state can
# never observably diverge, at the cost of one extra (idempotent, sub-second,
# write-if-changed) stamp-recipe invocation. Declared as a second prerequisite

# A framework-authored item record must not append a message to

# display text literally ("authoringName", src/data/items_expansion.json) and
# the generator emits it into a BUILD-LOCAL header that only the content
# profile links (scripts/generated_data/items/content_text.py).
#
# EXPANSION_STARTER_CONTENT is an env/config value exactly like
# FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP above: flipping it changes no source mtime, so it gets the

#
# No separate "stamp" file: `generate`'s own write-if-changed contract
# (scripts/generated_data/cgen.py's write_if_changed) already deliberately
# leaves the .c file's mtime untouched whenever regeneration reproduces

# Python generator may re-run when an input's mtime is merely touched
# without a real content change (e.g. right after a fresh checkout), but
# that only costs a fast no-op invocation; the .c file's mtime -- and
# therefore every downstream legacy/.o and modern build step -- only ever
# advances on a genuine content change. A stamp-file indirection was
# considered and rejected: it decouples "generation is current" from "the
# .c file exists with current content", which breaks the moment the two
# facts disagree (e.g. the .c is deleted, such as by `make clean`, while
# the stamp survives) -- the stamp would then be up to date and the .c
# rule would never regenerate the missing file. Depending on the real
# inputs directly avoids that failure mode entirely.

# JSON), but none of the legacy compile/assemble markers (`agbcc`,

# no generate/compile output at all (fully up to date), for every linked
# table serially (never overlapping two tables' rm+touch+rebuild windows
# in the same `$(MAKE)` invocation, so each table's captured log/hash
# evidence stays unambiguous). A from-scratch parallel (-j) build of

# plumbing hinges on `include generated_data.mk` happening before `all:`
# is defined in Makefile -- that a bare `make`/`make -n` still
# unconditionally resolves to the modern release AAPCS boot-check chain by
# default (issue #15: `all:` is a bare recipe target with no
# fireemblem8.gba/legacy prerequisite of any kind, and no environment or
# make command-line variable can redirect it), not generated-data-validate
# (generated_data.mk's own first target, which would otherwise silently
# steal GNU Make's implicit default-goal rule) and never the archival
# agbcc lane, while the explicit `legacy:` alias/`fireemblem8.gba` target
# stays reachable by name for the archival build this generated-data swap
# also has to keep linking correctly; the `-p` database probe itself uses
# `-rR` (--no-builtin-rules --no-builtin-variables) against a nonexistent

# Local/manual gate -- not CI wired, since CI's tool install

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linking a Chapter-2-owned partial-file table (Issue #5 Batch 3a)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Batch 2c-1..2c-4 (above) each replaced one *entire* hand-written
# src/data_<table>.c file with its generated equivalent -- viable only
# because each of those hand files contains nothing but that one global
# table. `units` (Batch 3a, the first Chapter-2-*owned* table to link) is
# structurally different: its hand definitions
# (`UnitDef_Event_Ch2Ally`/`UnitDef_Ch2Enemy_0`/`UnitDef_LordSplitAlly`/
# `UnitDef_Ch2Ally`/`UnitDef_Ch2NPC`/`UnitDef_Ch2Enemy_1`/
# `UnitDef_Ch2Enemy_2`, plus their private REDA sub-arrays) are only a
# *prefix slice* of src/events_udefs.c -- lines immediately after that
# file's own includes, ending right before Chapter 3's own REDA/
# UnitDefinition data begins. The same translation unit also defines
# every other chapter's units, which must stay hand-linked untouched, so
# this slice can't be excluded from compilation by filtering a whole
# file out of CFILES/MODERN_ALL_C_SOURCES the way GENERATED_DATA_LINKED_*
# above does.
#
# Instead, src/events_udefs.c carries its own self-contained guard:
# `#define GENERATED_DATA_UNITS_CH2_LINKED 1` immediately above the Ch2
# prefix block, which is itself wrapped in `#if !GENERATED_DATA_UNITS_CH2_LINKED
# / #endif`. Since the macro is unconditionally defined to 1 right there
# in the source, that block is permanently excluded from compilation --
# but its source text is left completely untouched, because
# generated-data-check's own round-trip parser (units/parser.py) reads
# src/events_udefs.c's raw text directly (brace-depth-aware regex, never
# the compiler) to keep proving the generated table byte-for-byte
# identical in meaning to it; preprocessor directives are invisible to
# that text-based parser, so the guard cannot desync the two.
#
# The excluded Ch2 block is a prefix of src/events_udefs.c's *own*
# top-level definitions, but NOT a prefix of the translation unit's
# compiled .data layout: the file's own two #include's just above it
# (src/events/prologue-eventudefs.h, src/events/ch1-eventudefs.h) emit
# Prologue/Chapter-1 REDA/UnitDefinition data first, ahead of Chapter 2,
# all still within the same events_udefs.o. So the generated Ch2 object
# must land, address-wise, *between* that still-hand Prologue/Ch1 data
# and events_udefs.c's own Chapter 3+ data -- not merely before the
# whole object. Since a single input section is placed by the linker as
# one atomic unit, right after the guard's closing #endif
# src/events_udefs.c redirects everything from Chapter 3 onward into a
# second, distinctly-named section (`#undef CONST_DATA` /
# `#define CONST_DATA SECTION(".data.ch2tail")`), splitting
# events_udefs.o's .data into two independently-placeable pieces of the
# *same* object file:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): src/events_udefs.o(.data) (Prologue/Ch1,
#     unchanged), then build/generated/data/data_ch2_units.o(.data),
#     then src/events_udefs.o(.data.ch2tail) (Chapter 3+, unchanged) --
#     each piece lands at exactly its original address, so the ROM is
#     byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp` against a pre-change
#     ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): modern's own MODERN_ELF_OBJECTS_LST/MANIFEST
#     $(sort) the full object list to decide floating-.data placement
#     order (see the GENERATED_DATA_LINKED_C reinstatement comment in
#     modern.mk) -- there is no "original hand path" to reuse here since
#     this object is additive, not a replacement, so it is instead
#     reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/events_u-ch2units.o) deliberately chosen
#     to sort immediately between src/events_trapdata.o and
#     src/events_udefs.o. Modern's per-object (not per-input-section)
#     sort keeps events_udefs.o's two sections (.data and .data.ch2tail)
#     adjacent to each other regardless, so the synthetic slot ends up
#     immediately before events_udefs.o as a whole rather than truly
#     between its two pieces -- an acceptable, already-documented
#     divergence for the modern build (see the "Batch 3a" docs section:
#     modern's requirement is a successful, shiftable build, not literal
#     re-derivation of legacy's byte layout).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linking a Chapter-2-owned partial-file table with two non-adjacent hand
# blocks (Issue #5 Batch 3b)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `traps` is structurally like `units` (Batch 3a, above) in that its two
# Chapter 2 symbols (`TrapData_Event_Ch2`, `TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard`) are
# only a slice of src/events_trapdata.c, a translation unit that also
# defines every other chapter's (and every other difficulty's) trap
# arrays, which must stay hand-linked untouched.
#
# It differs from `units` in one important way: `TrapData_Event_Ch2` and
# `TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard` are *not* adjacent to each other in the file --
# the file is laid out as one normal-mode block (Prologue..Ch19B, which
# is where TrapData_Event_Ch2 lives, right after Ch1) followed by one
# hard-mode block (PrologueHard..DebugMap_22, which is where
# TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard lives, ~1850 lines later, right after
# Ch1Hard). Excluding both from compilation via a single `#if !GUARD /
# #endif` region (like units' single contiguous prefix) is not possible
# since they aren't contiguous; instead src/events_trapdata.c wraps each
# in its own `#if !GENERATED_DATA_TRAPS_CH2_LINKED / #endif` region,
# sharing one guard macro (defined once, immediately above the first
# region).
#
# Since a single input section is placed by the linker as one atomic
# unit, and the two symbols must land at two addresses roughly 1850
# hand-written trap-array lines apart, splicing in one generated object
# containing both symbols in the *same* default section (the units
# approach) would force one of the two symbols to move far from its
# original address -- an avoidable, unquantifiably-large single-symbol
# jump. Instead, this table's generator
# (scripts/generated_data/traps/generate.py) places
# `TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard` alone into its own dedicated section
# (`.data.trapch2hard`) distinct from `TrapData_Event_Ch2`'s ordinary
# `.data`, so the *same* generated object can be spliced into ldscript.txt
# at two independent points. Combined with two `#undef CONST_DATA` /
# `#define CONST_DATA SECTION(...)` redirects in src/events_trapdata.c
# (right after each guard's closing #endif -- first to `.data.trapch2mid`
# for Chapter 3 through Ch1Hard, then to `.data.traptail` for Ch3Hard
# through end-of-file), this produces a four-piece split with *zero*
# address shift anywhere:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): src/events_trapdata.o(.data) (Prologue..Ch1,
#     unchanged), build/generated/data/data_ch2_traps.o(.data) (the
#     generated TrapData_Event_Ch2), src/events_trapdata.o(.data.trapch2mid)
#     (Ch3..Ch1Hard, unchanged), build/generated/data/data_ch2_traps.o
#     (.data.trapch2hard) (the generated TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard), then
#     src/events_trapdata.o(.data.traptail) (Ch3Hard..EOF, unchanged) --
#     each piece lands at exactly its original address, so the ROM is
#     byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp` against a pre-change
#     ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as the units table's synthetic
#     slot -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-section, and this
#     object is additive (no "original hand path" to reuse), so it is
#     reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/events_t-ch2traps.o) chosen to sort
#     immediately before src/events_trapdata.o -- an acceptable,
#     already-documented divergence for the modern build (see the
#     "Batch 3a" docs section: modern's requirement is a successful,
#     shiftable build, not literal re-derivation of legacy's byte
#     layout).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linking a single Chapter-2-owned interior symbol in a shared shop-list
# file (Issue #5 Batch 3c)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `shops` is structurally like `units` (Batch 3a, above): its one Chapter
# 2 symbol (`ShopList_Event_Ch2Armory`) is only a slice of
# src/events_shoplist.c, a translation unit that also defines every other
# shop's item list, which must stay hand-linked untouched -- so this
# slice can't be excluded from compilation by filtering a whole file out
# of CFILES/MODERN_ALL_C_SOURCES the way GENERATED_DATA_LINKED_* does.
#
# Unlike `units`, `ShopList_Event_Ch2Armory` is not a *prefix* of the
# file: it sits in the *interior*, sandwiched between still-hand
# `ShopList_Tower*`/`ShopList_Ruin*` arrays above it and the still-hand
# `ShopList_Event_Ch5Armory` (and every later shop) below it. The same
# single-guard, single-section-redirect technique still applies, just
# with both a real prefix *and* a real suffix to preserve, rather than
# only a suffix:
#   * src/events_shoplist.c defines
#     `#define GENERATED_DATA_SHOPS_CH2_LINKED 1` immediately above the
#     array, itself wrapped in
#     `#if !GENERATED_DATA_SHOPS_CH2_LINKED / #endif` -- source preserved
#     verbatim (never deleted), excluded from compilation, still read
#     directly by generated-data-check's round-trip parser
#     (scripts/generated_data/shops/parser.py), which is text-based and
#     therefore blind to the preprocessor guard around it.
#   * Right after the guard's closing `#endif`, `#undef CONST_DATA` /
#     `#define CONST_DATA SECTION(".data.shopch2tail")` redirects
#     everything from `ShopList_Event_Ch5Armory` onward (through
#     end-of-file) into a second, distinctly-named section, splitting
#     events_shoplist.o's .data into two independently-placeable pieces
#     of the same object file.
#
# Both the array's start (0x89ED7CC) and end (0x89ED7D8) addresses fall
# on natural 4-byte boundaries -- a 6-entry u16[] (5 items + 1
# ITEM_NONE terminator) is always a multiple of 4 bytes -- so, unlike the
# traps table's packed u8[] split (which required dropping internal
# ALIGN(4) to avoid padding), this split keeps ". = ALIGN(4);" at every
# piece, exactly like the units table's three-piece split:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): src/events_shoplist.o(.data) (the still-hand
#     Tower*/Ruin* prefix, unchanged), then
#     build/generated/data/data_ch2_shops.o(.data) (the generated
#     ShopList_Event_Ch2Armory), then
#     src/events_shoplist.o(.data.shopch2tail) (Ch5Armory onward,
#     unchanged) -- each piece lands at exactly its original address, so
#     the ROM is byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp` against a
#     pre-change ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as the units/traps synthetic
#     slots -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-section, and
#     this object is additive (no "original hand path" to reuse), so it
#     is reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/events_sh-ch2shops.o) chosen to sort
#     immediately before src/events_shoplist.o -- an acceptable,
#     already-documented divergence for the modern build (modern's
#     requirement is a successful, shiftable build, not literal
#     re-derivation of legacy's byte layout).

# Linking a Chapter-2-owned table whose Chapter 2 content lives in its own
# header, not inline in a shared hand .c file (Issue #5 Batch 3d)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `eventlists` is structurally like `units`/`traps`/`shops` (Batch
# 3a/3b/3c, above) in that its Chapter 2 content is only a slice of a
# translation unit that also composes every other chapter's own
# equivalent data, which must stay hand-linked untouched. It differs in
# *where* that slice lives: `src/events_info.c` never defines any
# EventListScr/ChapterEventGroup data directly -- it is nothing but a
# long sequence of per-chapter `#include "events/<chapter>-eventinfo.h"`
# directives, and Chapter 2's entire contribution
# (`EventListScr_Ch2_Turn`/`_Character`/`_Location`/`_Misc`/
# `_SelectUnit`/`_SelectDestination`/`_UnitMove`,
# `EventListScr_Ch2_Tutorial`, and `struct ChapterEventGroup Ch2Events`)
# lives entirely in its own header, `src/events/ch2-eventinfo.h`. So
# instead of an `#if !GUARD / #endif` region wrapped around inline
# array/struct definitions (units/traps/shops), `src/events_info.c` wraps
# the *`#include` directive itself* in the guard -- the header file is
# still preserved verbatim on disk (never deleted), still read directly
# by generated-data-check's round-trip parser
# (scripts/generated_data/eventlists/parser.py), just never actually
# `#include`d into the compiled translation unit once the guard macro is
# defined to 1.
#
# Right after the guard's closing `#endif`, `#undef CONST_DATA` /
# `#define CONST_DATA SECTION(".data.ch2eventtail")` redirects everything
# from Chapter 3 onward (through end-of-file) into a second, distinctly
# named section, splitting events_info.o's .data into two
# independently-placeable pieces of the same object file -- identical
# technique to units' `.data.ch2tail` and shops'
# `.data.shopch2tail`, just under its own name so as not to collide with
# either (section names are already fully object-file-qualified in
# ldscript.txt, so a literal name collision would not actually break the
# link, but a distinct name keeps each split's ldscript.txt comments/
# grep-based checks unambiguous).
#
# Chapter 2's block spans exactly [0x89E942C, 0x89E95C4) -- 0x198 (408)
# bytes -- both boundaries falling on natural 4-byte boundaries (every
# EventListScr array is terminated by an END_MAIN macro that expands to a
# whole 4-byte-aligned struct, and Ch2Events itself is a pointer-heavy
# struct), so, exactly like the units/shops tables' three-piece splits,
# ". = ALIGN(4);" at each internal seam below is safe and adds zero
# padding:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): src/events_info.o(.data) (the still-hand
#     Prologue/Ch1 prefix, unchanged), then
#     build/generated/data/data_ch2_eventlists.o(.data) (the generated
#     9 symbols), then src/events_info.o(.data.ch2eventtail) (Chapter 3+
#     onward, unchanged) -- each piece lands at exactly its original
#     address, so the ROM is byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp`
#     against a pre-change ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as the units/traps/shops
#     synthetic slots -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-section,
#     and this object is additive (no "original hand path" to reuse), so
#     it is reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/events_i-ch2eventlists.o) chosen to sort

#     already-documented divergence for the modern build (modern's
#     requirement is a successful, shiftable build, not literal
#     re-derivation of legacy's byte layout).
#
# Unlike `units`/`traps`/`shops`, `eventlists`' own schema declares
# `dependency_tables()` (`units`, `shops`, `traps`, `eventscripts`) --
# see scripts/generated_data/eventlists/schema.py -- so its generated .c
# is additionally regenerated whenever any of those tables' own
# src/data/ch2_*.json sources change, not just its own

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linking a partial-file table with two non-adjacent hand blocks, neither
# Chapter-2-owned (Issue #5 Batch 1: mechanics terrainstats)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `terrainstats` is structurally identical to `traps` (Batch 3b, above) --
# two non-adjacent symbol groups sharing one guard macro, split across a
# shared hand file -- but it is the first *non-chapter-scoped* table
# linked this way: its 8 symbols (`TerrainTable_Avo_Common`/`Def_Common`/
# `Res_Common`/`Avo_Fly`/`Def_Fly`/`Res_Fly`/`HealAmount`/`HealsStatus`)
# are global combat/heal stat lookups consumed by every chapter's map
# logic and by `ClassData`'s own `terrainAvoid`/`terrainDefense`/
# `terrainResistance` pointers (see `classes/schema.py`'s dependency on
# this table), not a single chapter's own data.
#
# The 6 `TerrainTable_Avo_*`/`Def_*`/`Res_*` arrays are contiguous in
# src/data_terrains.c, immediately after `Unk_TerrainTable_2` (an
# unresearched escape-hatch array that must stay hand-linked); 5 more
# unresearched `Unk_TerrainTable_3`..`Unk_TerrainTable_7` escape hatches
# then sit between that block and `TerrainTable_HealAmount`/
# `TerrainTable_HealsStatus`, which are immediately followed by the
# `BanimTerrainGround_*`/`gBanimBGLut*` graphics tables (also
# hand-linked, out of scope). Both groups are wrapped in their own
# `#if !GENERATED_DATA_TERRAINSTATS_LINKED` / `#endif` region sharing one
# guard macro (defined once, immediately above the first region), exactly
# like traps' `TrapData_Event_Ch2`/`TrapData_Event_Ch2Hard`.
#
# Since a single input section is placed by the linker as one atomic
# unit, and the two groups must land at two addresses ~5 escape-hatch
# arrays apart, this table's generator
# (scripts/generated_data/terrainstats/generate.py) places
# `TerrainTable_HealAmount`/`TerrainTable_HealsStatus` alone into their
# own dedicated section (`.data.terrainheal`) distinct from the 6 Avo/
# Def/Res arrays' ordinary `.data`, so the *same* generated object can be
# spliced into ldscript.txt at two independent points. Combined with two
# `#undef CONST_DATA` / `#define CONST_DATA SECTION(...)` redirects in
# src/data_terrains.c (right after each guard's closing #endif -- first
# to `.data.terrainmid` for Unk_TerrainTable_3..7, then to
# `.data.terraintail` for BanimTerrainGroundDefault onward), this
# produces a five-piece split with *zero* address shift anywhere:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): src/data_terrains.o(.data) (movement-cost
#     tables + Unk_TerrainTable_1/2, unchanged),
#     build/generated/data/data_terrainstats.o(.data) (the generated 6
#     Avo/Def/Res arrays), src/data_terrains.o(.data.terrainmid)
#     (Unk_TerrainTable_3..7, unchanged),
#     build/generated/data/data_terrainstats.o(.data.terrainheal) (the
#     generated HealAmount/HealsStatus), then
#     src/data_terrains.o(.data.terraintail) (BanimTerrainGround_*
#     onward, unchanged) -- each piece lands at exactly its original
#     address, so the ROM is byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp`
#     against a pre-change ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as traps'/units' synthetic slot
#     -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-section, and this
#     object is additive (no "original hand path" to reuse), so it is
#     reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/data_t-terrainstats.o) chosen to sort
#     immediately before src/data_terrains.o -- an acceptable,
#     already-documented divergence for the modern build (see the
#     "Batch 3a" docs section: modern's requirement is a successful,
#     shiftable build, not literal re-derivation of legacy's byte
#     layout).

# Chapter-2-owned (Issue #5 Batch 2: mechanics movecost)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `movecost` is the same "shared guard macro, multiple non-adjacent
# groups redirected into their own named sections" technique as
# `terrainstats` (Batch 1, above), but with a three-piece, not five-piece,
# split, and it is the literal *first* content of src/data_terrains.c
# (unlike terrainstats, which starts partway through the file):
#
#   * Piece A (32 symbols: all 15 named mobility profiles' Normal array,
#     TerrainTable_MovCost_DemonKing, TerrainMoveCost_Ballista, then all
#     15 named profiles' Rain array) is the literal first content of the
#     file's plain `.data` section -- no redirect needed, it is already
#     what ldscript.txt's `src/data_terrains.o(.data)` line represents
#     today.
#   * Unk_TerrainTable_1 (an unresearched escape hatch) immediately
#     follows, still in plain `.data`, unchanged.
#   * Piece B (15 symbols: all 15 named profiles' Snow array) comes next
#     in the original file, so it is redirected into its own
#     `.data.movecostsnow` section (via `#undef CONST_DATA` / `#define
#     CONST_DATA SECTION(...)` right after Unk_TerrainTable_1, mirroring
#     terrainstats' own `.data.terrainmid`/`.data.terraintail`
#     technique) so the *same* generated object can be spliced in at a
#     second, independent ldscript.txt position.
#   * Unk_TerrainTable_2 (another escape hatch) follows Piece B, and is
#     itself redirected into a third, distinct section
#     (`.data.movecosttail`) -- not a revert to plain `.data` -- because
#     terrainstats' own already-linked guard (Issue #5 Batch 1)
#     immediately follows Unk_TerrainTable_2 in the file and still
#     references plain `CONST_DATA` for its own (permanently excluded,
#     zero-byte) first guarded block, only redirecting forward to its
#     own `.data.terrainmid` after *its* `#endif`.
#
# This produces a three-piece split with *zero* address shift anywhere:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): build/generated/data/data_movecost.o(.data)
#     (the generated 32 Normal/DemonKing/Ballista/Rain arrays),
#     src/data_terrains.o(.data) (now just Unk_TerrainTable_1, since
#     Piece A above it is excluded),
#     build/generated/data/data_movecost.o(.data.movecostsnow) (the
#     generated 15 Snow arrays),
#     src/data_terrains.o(.data.movecosttail) (now just
#     Unk_TerrainTable_2), then the existing terrainstats splice
#     (unchanged) -- each piece lands at exactly its original address,
#     so the ROM is byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp` against a
#     pre-change ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as terrainstats' synthetic slot
#     -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-section, so this
#     additive object is reinstated at a synthetic slot path
#     ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/data_t-movecost.o) chosen to sort
#     immediately before src/data_terrains.o.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Linking a partial-file table, single guard, single top-level symbol
# (Issue #5 mechanics Batch 3: weapontriangle)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# `weapontriangle` is the simplest partial-file link yet: unlike
# terrainstats/movecost (two non-adjacent groups sharing one guard) or
# units (a guarded prefix with hand content both before *and* after it),
# sWeaponTriangleRules is a single 12-record table (52 bytes with its
# implicit `{ -1 }` terminator) that is the literal *first* content of
# src/bmbattle.c's own `.data` section -- there is no hand content ahead
# of it to worry about, only sProcScr_BattleAnimSimpleLock (a single
# ProcCmd array) immediately after it in the same file.
#
# `src/bmbattle.c` defines `#define GENERATED_DATA_WEAPONTRIANGLE_LINKED 1`
# immediately above the guarded block (`#if !GENERATED_DATA_WEAPONTRIANGLE_LINKED
# / #endif`, with an `#else extern struct WeaponTriangleRule
# sWeaponTriangleRules[]; #endif` so BattleApplyWeaponTriangleEffect --
# unchanged, still in this same file -- keeps compiling/referencing the
# same symbol/type). The shared `struct WeaponTriangleRule` type itself
# lives in include/bmbattle.h (not src/bmbattle.c), so both the guarded
# hand block and this generated object -- separate translation units --
# see the exact same layout without either redefining it. Right after
# the guard's closing #endif, `src/bmbattle.c` redirects everything else
# it defines (`#undef CONST_DATA` / `#define CONST_DATA
# SECTION(".data.bmbattletail")`) so sProcScr_BattleAnimSimpleLock (and
# any future addition) lands in its own section, distinct from plain
# `.data` -- letting the generated object take over exactly
# sWeaponTriangleRules' original address with zero shift:
#   * legacy (ldscript.txt): build/generated/data/data_weapontriangle.o
#     (.data) (the generated 12 rules + terminator) lands at
#     sWeaponTriangleRules' exact original address (zero shift);
#     src/bmbattle.o(.data.bmbattletail) (sProcScr_BattleAnimSimpleLock)
#     resumes immediately after, unchanged -- so the ROM is
#     byte-identical overall (verified via `cmp` against a pre-change
#     ROM).
#   * modern (modern.mk): same reasoning as terrainstats'/movecost's
#     synthetic slot -- modern links whole objects, not per-input-
#     section, so this additive object is reinstated at a synthetic slot
#     path ($(MODERN_OUTPUT_DIR)/src/bmb-weapontriangle.o) chosen to sort
#     immediately before src/bmbattle.o (the only other src/bmb*.o file).

# recipe above) defends against an out-of-band, wrong-cap write to the
# ephemeral generated items .c even when (a) the cap stamp still records the
# default cap and (b) the poisoned .c mtime outranks every tracked input --
# the exact state the item-cap CLI check test used to leave behind in the
# shared build/ tree, which a later plain default build would then silently
# link at 207 records. Local/manual (not CI wired): the object half needs
# the archival agbcc pipeline CI deliberately does not install, exactly like

# Issue #10 cap-flip follow-up: ACTIVE-header stamp/header desync self-heal
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Companion to generated-data-cap-heal-check above, but guarding the *ACTIVE
# header* half of the contract rather than the generated .c half -- and
# deliberately host-only (no agbcc/arm toolchain), so CI covers it even where
# the object build is unavailable. The real modern compile proof of the same
# recovery (the negative static assert that a stale header would trigger)
# lives in modern.mk's expansion-modern-idspace-active-check "desync recovery"
# leg.
#
# Reproduces the exact reported first-fail: a differently-capped, out-of-band
# `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make generated-data-check` write-if-changes the
# build-local ACTIVE header to 0xCE (advancing its mtime) while never touching
# $(GENERATED_DATA_ITEM_CAP_STAMP). On the next plain/default build the
# resolved cap is unchanged, so the stamp mtime does not advance, the 0xCE
# header looks newer than the stamp, the stamp-driven grouped rule is judged
# up to date and never re-renders -- yet data_items.c still regenerates at the
# default cap, leaving a 206-record table that #includes a 207-record header
# (a negative static assert on the first consumer compile). The stamp recipe's
# ACTIVE-header self-heal must restore the header to the resolved cap on the
# first plain build, with no manual generated-data-check and no clean.
