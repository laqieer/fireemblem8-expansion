# External link registry

Every external (`http`/`https`) URL occurrence in every Markdown file in
this repository -- including inside inline code spans, but not fenced
code blocks -- must be covered by a rule below, matched by
[`scripts/check_docs.py`](../scripts/check_docs.py). This is **syntax and
ownership/status registry coverage only**; it never performs a network
request. A URL is "covered" when its host (for a `host:` rule) or its full
string (for a `prefix:` rule) matches; the checker also enforces that
every `github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8u*` / `decomp.dev/laqieer/fireemblem8u*`
occurrence specifically matches a rule whose status is
`historical-upstream` (never `authoritative-self`) -- this repository's
own docs are authoritative; the upstream wiki/tracker are provenance
context, not a mirrored source of truth (see
[`docs/project-governance.md`](project-governance.md#credits-and-downstream-context)).

Each line is `- pattern | owner | status | notes` where `pattern` is
either `host:<exact netloc>` or `prefix:<literal URL prefix, checked with
str.startswith>`. Rules are matched in file order; keep the more specific
`prefix:` rules for a host above any catch-all `host:` rule for the same
host if a broader host-level entry is also listed for it. Deliberately a
small, bespoke, line-oriented, stdlib-parseable format -- not YAML/JSON
and not a third-party Markdown/link-checker library.

## Status enum

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `authoritative-self` | This repository's own GitHub project surface (Actions, issues, badges). |
| `historical-upstream` | The upstream fireemblem8u decomp project (wiki/tracker/blob links) -- provenance, not mirrored truth. |
| `downstream-reference` | Projects/sites that consume this repo, kept for credits/context. |
| `third-party-reference` | External tools/docs/services this project merely links to. |

The issue #6/#18 Markdown merged into the current tree is covered by the
same exact occurrence scan; it introduces no new unclassified host/prefix.
This statement reflects offline syntax/registry coverage only, never an online
availability check.

## Coverage note on prefix rule count

`docs/tsa_audit.md` alone contributes several hundred pinned
`github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8u/blob/<sha>/...` asset links; one
`prefix:` rule covers all of them (and any future ones under the same
repo) instead of one registry line per pinned link.
