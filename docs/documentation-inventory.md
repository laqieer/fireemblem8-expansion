# Documentation inventory

This is the machine-checked, exact-coverage registry of **every** file
with a recognized Markdown extension, tracked (or untracked-but-not-
ignored, in a dev worktree) in this repository (see
[`docs/README.md`](README.md) for the human-oriented narrative
index/learning-paths view of the same set). The recognized extension set
is small, explicit, and documented: `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdn`
(matched case-insensitively -- see
[`scripts/check_docs.py`](../scripts/check_docs.py)'s
`RECOGNIZED_MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS`); an unrecognized extension (`.txt`,
`.mdx`, ...) is never swept in just because it looks Markdown-adjacent.
`scripts/check_docs.py` parses the delimited block below and fails closed
if:

- any Git-tracked or untracked-but-not-ignored file whose extension is one
  of the recognized Markdown extensions above (discovered from the full
  `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` listing filtered by
  extension in Python -- not a `*.md`-only pathspec glob, which would
  silently miss any other recognized extension) is missing an entry here,
  or
- any entry here references a recognized-Markdown-extension path that
  doesn't exist/isn't tracked, or
- any entry has an empty owner/scope, or a `status` outside the controlled
  enum below.

Each line is `- path | owner | status | scope` (exactly four
`|`-delimited fields). This is a deliberately small, bespoke,
line-oriented format -- not YAML/JSON and not parsed by any third-party
Markdown library, so it stays stdlib-parseable and diff-friendly.

## Status enum

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `current` | Authoritative, actively maintained, expected to reflect `master`. |
| `historical` | Archival / point-in-time; not re-verified against `master`. |
| `generated` | Machine-generated report/inventory -- never hand-edit its content (only this registry's metadata *about* it). |
| `subsystem-reference` | Deep reference scoped to one subsystem/tool, not part of the top-level learning path. |
| `deprecated` | Superseded; kept only for compatibility/history. |
| `evidence` | Issue/closure *candidate* evidence report -- explicitly not a closure claim. |
| `template` | Intentionally unfilled scaffolding. |

## Notes

- `owner` is maintainer/DRI (directly-responsible-individual) routing
  metadata: the person accountable for this file's content and who to
  route questions/reviews to. It records human responsibility, **not**
  automated GitHub review enforcement, and it is **not** a claim of
  per-file solo authorship.
- This `owner` field is independent of `.github/CODEOWNERS`. Only paths
  that `.github/CODEOWNERS` explicitly lists get any automatic
  reviewer-request behavior from GitHub; as of this writing that file
  lists a small, specific set of protected baseline/fingerprint and
  artifact-governance paths (see that file directly for the current
  list), not every path in this inventory. A file's `owner` here does
  not imply -- and must never be read as implying -- that the same path
  is also matched by a `.github/CODEOWNERS` rule.
- Adding a new Markdown file anywhere in this repository requires adding
  an entry here in the same change, or `scripts/check_docs.py --check`
  fails. Deleting a Markdown file requires removing its entry.
- This inventory does not record line counts, byte counts, or any other
  value that drifts on every unrelated edit -- only the path/owner/status/
  scope quadruple, which is stable unless the file's actual role changes.
