# Extensible ID space (Issue #10)

This framework turns "expandable IDs" into a configurable, auditable,
fail-early platform. It is built around one single source of truth --
`scripts/generated_data/idspace.py` -- that describes every extensible ID
domain (character, class, item, chapter, unit, event) and every consumer
(runtime tables, event operands, save fields, UI buffers, lookup tables,
link/network representations, external interfaces) that must never silently
truncate an expanded ID.

## DEFAULT contract vs ACTIVE contract (read this first)

There are two contracts, and mixing them up is the mistake this framework now
makes impossible:

| | DEFAULT (committed) | ACTIVE (build-local) |
|---|---|---|
| Where | `include/id_space.h`, `reports/id_space_audit.{json,md}`, `reports/generated_data_manifest.md` | `build/generated/data/id_space_active.h`, `id_space_active_audit.{json,md}` |
| Item cap / records | always `0xCD` / `206` | whatever this build resolved (`0xCE` / `207` with `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE`) |
| Changes with `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP`? | **never** (byte-identical at every cap) | yes, that is its whole job |
| Tracked in git? | yes | no (ephemeral, under `build/`) |

The committed surfaces describe the *vanilla* platform: what a fresh checkout,
the archival agbcc lane and an un-configured modern build compile against. They
are deliberately env-independent, so opting into an expanded cap can never show
up as tracked drift or force a report rewrite.

**Never quote a committed report as the active value.** A configured build
publishes its own numbers:

```console
$ FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make generated-data-check
...
active id-space contract up-to-date (3 outputs); item cap 0xCE, 207 record(s)

$ grep ITEM_ID build/generated/data/id_space_active.h
#define ITEM_ID_DEFAULT_CAP 0xCD
#define ITEM_ID_ACTIVE_CONFIGURED_CAP 0xCE
#define ITEM_ID_DEFAULT_RECORD_COUNT 206
#define ITEM_ID_ACTIVE_RECORD_COUNT 207
#define ITEM_ID_ACTIVE_EXPANDED 1
```

Downstream consumers:

- **Tools / scripts** read `build/generated/data/id_space_active_audit.json`
  (`domains[].active_configured_cap`, `domains[].active_record_count`, plus the
  `default_*` twins and an explicit `record_count_status` of `counted` or `n/a`
  with a written reason for domains that have no record table).
- **Humans** read `build/generated/data/id_space_active_audit.md`.
- **C code** includes the generated `id_space_active.h`. The generated item
  table already does, and asserts at compile time that the compiler cap and the
  emitted table agree:

  ```c
  ID_SPACE_STATIC_ASSERT(ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP == ITEM_ID_ACTIVE_CONFIGURED_CAP, ...);
  ID_SPACE_STATIC_ASSERT(sizeof(gItemData) / sizeof(gItemData[0]) == ITEM_ID_ACTIVE_RECORD_COUNT, ...);
  ```

  So a stale header, a stale table, or a build that flows a different
  `-DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP` than the generator saw is a hard compile error instead of
  a silently truncated table. `make expansion-modern-idspace-active-check`
  proves all three directions (default compiles, configured compiles, mismatch
  fails) with the real modern toolchain. The archival agbcc lane stays
  default-only and keeps its existing fast-fail guard.

  The gate itself is hermetic: `make expansion-modern-idspace-active-check`,
  `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make expansion-modern-idspace-active-check`, and
  `make expansion-modern-idspace-active-check FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE` all PASS
  identically, regardless of the caller's ambient shell environment or
  command-line assignment -- the gate's own recipe pins each of its three cap
  states explicitly (never `$(MODERN_CFLAGS)`'s ambient-baked cap define, and
  never a plain env-var prefix on a recursive `$(MAKE)`, which GNU Make's own
  command-line-beats-environment precedence can silently override) rather than
  inheriting whatever cap the caller happened to be running under. See
  `scripts/modernize/tests/test_idspace_active_check_gate_hermetic.py`.

  **Automatic build self-heal (cap-flip / stale / heal).** Any modern
  configured or default build regenerates the ACTIVE header *and* the generated
  table to match *its own* resolved cap **before** the first consumer compiles
  -- you never have to run `make generated-data-check` by hand first. The
  `.item_id_cap.stamp` recipe is a `FORCE` prerequisite of `data_items.c`, so it
  runs on every build and heals both surfaces write-if-changed: a
  mtime-preserving no-op at the correct cap (no rebuild storm), a single rewrite
  (recompiling exactly the affected object) when either surface is stale.
  This closes a real first-fail that a final verifier reproduced and that this
  doc deliberately does not hide: an out-of-band, differently-capped
  `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make generated-data-check` write-if-changes the ACTIVE
  header to 0xCE (advancing *its* mtime) while never touching the cap stamp; on
  the next plain/default build the resolved cap is unchanged, so the stamp mtime
  does not advance, the 0xCE header looks newer than the stamp, and the
  stamp-driven grouped rule -- keyed only on the stamp's mtime -- is judged up
  to date and never re-renders. The table `data_items.c` *does* regenerate at
  the default cap, so a 206-record table ends up `#include`-ing a 207-record
  header: exactly the negative static assert above, on the very first compile,
  which previously required a manual `make generated-data-check` to recover.
  Healing the ACTIVE surfaces inside the stamp recipe (keyed off the make
  process's own resolved cap) makes the recovery automatic and single-command in
  every direction, including `-j`. Regression coverage:
  `make generated-data-active-heal-check` (host-only: default->0xCE->default and
  the reverse, correct-cap no-op, no clean) and the "desync recovery" leg of
  `make expansion-modern-idspace-active-check` (the same recovery proven with a
  real modern compile, so the stale-header negative assert can never silently
  return).

  **The heal is a sub-second probe, not a full audit re-render.** Because this
  runs on *every* build, the stamp recipe calls `idspace active-heal`, not
  `idspace active-check`. `active-check` re-renders the ACTIVE surfaces through
  the full consumer census -- a ~15 MB source walk (658 files / ~1070 hits),
  ~8-11 s -- which turned every warm no-op build into a fixed multi-second tax.
  `active-heal` instead runs a census-free probe: it computes only the resolved
  cap and the real record counts (a fraction of a second) and compares them to
  the cap/count/schema metadata already written in the on-disk header, JSON and
  Markdown. When every surface already agrees it returns immediately -- no
  census, no write, no mtime change, so the warm no-op is now on par with the
  neighbouring items-table self-heal instead of dominating the build. Only a
  missing, unparseable, schema-outdated, or cap/count-mismatched surface falls
  through to a single full `active-generate` (census included). There is no
  `|| true` mask: a bad `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP` or a schema/IO error fails the build
  loudly here rather than silently deferring to a later gate. Ordinary
  source/classification drift stays owned by the grouped rule's Make
  prerequisites (`generated-data-check` remains the authoritative full-census
  validation gate); the probe owns only the cheap "is what's on disk still true
  for *this* resolved cap" question. A header or Markdown surface that is
  missing, truncated, or simply not valid UTF-8 (a corrupt/partial write, not a
  cap/count mismatch) is caught (`OSError`/`UnicodeDecodeError`) and recorded as
  the same actionable `unparseable: <file> (...)` reason the JSON surface
  already used, then healed by the same full regen -- never an unhandled
  decode traceback. The regen's own write-if-changed comparison is symmetric:
  it no longer needs to *decode* the stale on-disk bytes to know they differ,
  so a corrupt file never blocks its own repair; only a genuine write failure
  (permission denied, read-only filesystem) still raises straight out, honestly,
  rather than being reported as a false "healed" success. The probe's
  no-op-never-scans contract and every stale/missing/corrupt/IO-error path are
  covered by `ActiveHealProbeTests` in
  `scripts/generated_data/tests/test_idspace_active.py`.

## What the single source produces

Running `python3 -m scripts.generated_data.idspace generate` deterministically
renders three committed (DEFAULT) surfaces from that one description:

- `include/id_space.h` -- C89 / agbcc-safe typed aliases plus
  width/signedness/sentinel/technical-max/configured-cap macros and
  compile-time `ID_SPACE_STATIC_ASSERT` cap-fits-storage guarantees.
- `reports/id_space_audit.json` -- machine-readable consumer audit (with a
  stable sha256 digest).
- `reports/id_space_audit.md` -- the human audit, generated from the exact
  same rows so the two never disagree.

`python3 -m scripts.generated_data.idspace active-generate` renders the three
build-local ACTIVE surfaces described above (`--out-dir` defaults to
`build/generated/data`), and `active-check` self-heals plus verifies them.

`python3 -m scripts.generated_data.idspace check` re-renders in memory and
fails on any configured-cap violation or committed-output drift. Both checks,
plus the consumer census below, are folded into `make generated-data-check`, so
the existing umbrella CI gate covers them with no workflow edits.

## Source-driven consumer census (how coverage is proven)

The consumer table in both audits is **generated from the source tree**, not
curated by hand. `scripts/generated_data/consumer_census.py` scans `include/`,
`src/`, `asm/` and `tools/gba-playtest/` for every declaration that stores,
serialises, decodes or exposes an extensible ID -- struct/bitfield members,
ID-typed tables and arrays, public signatures and macros, event operand/decoder
macros, assembly symbols, host-tool constants -- and every hit must map 1:1 to
a row in `scripts/generated_data/consumer_classification.json`.

- A hit key is `path|kind|domain|symbol` (never a line number), so re-indenting
  a header does not churn the classification; the line is carried as evidence
  only.
- A **new** consumer that nobody classified fails `generated-data-check` with
  its key, kind and `path:line`.
- A classified row whose declaration **disappeared** fails as stale.
- A same-named false positive (for example `MenuProc.itemCount`, which counts
  menu rows, or `Tsa_PrepItemSupplyBgA`, which is tilemap bytes) is never
  silently pattern-ignored: it is classified `reviewed-exclusion` with a
  written reason, and both audits print those rows in their own table.
- What the scan structurally cannot resolve (assembly semantics, struct-typed
  data instances, function bodies) is listed as a coverage limitation inside
  the generated audits.

### Workflow: adding or changing a consumer

1. Write the code as usual.
2. Run `make generated-data-check` (or
   `python3 -m scripts.generated_data.consumer_census check`). A new consumer
   fails with an actionable key.
3. Propose rows with
   `python3 -m scripts.generated_data.consumer_census bootstrap`, then **review
   every new row by hand**: pick the real category
   (`runtime-struct`, `runtime-macro`, `event-operand`, `save-field`,
   `ui-buffer`, `lookup-table`, `link-network`, `external-interface`) or
   `reviewed-exclusion` plus a reason that states what the symbol actually
   stores.
4. Regenerate the audits (`make generated-data-generate`) and commit the
   classification together with the code that introduced the consumer.

If the scanner genuinely cannot see a real consumer, fix the scanner rules --
never hand-append a row that the scan cannot reproduce.

## Per-domain caps and cost

Each domain declares a storage width, signedness, sentinel, technical maximum
(what the storage can physically hold) and a configured cap (the finite value
actually enabled today). See `reports/id_space_audit.md` for the full table
and per-domain ROM/RAM/on-media budget notes. Summary:

| Domain | Storage | Technical max | Configured cap | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| character | u8 | 0xFF | 0xFF | at storage max (256-record padding) |
| class | 7-bit jid save field | 0x7F | 0x7F | frozen (0x80 truncates on save) |
| item | u8 index / 14-bit save | 0xFF | 0xCD (opt-in 0xCE..0xFF) | expandable |
| chapter | s8 | 0x7F | 0x7F | frozen (negatives reserved) |
| unit | u8, 0x40 faction stride | 0x3F | 0x3F | frozen (partition collision) |
| event | 16-bit operand lane | 0xFFFF | 0xFF | adequate headroom |

## Choosing a cap

1. Read the domain row in `reports/id_space_audit.md` for its technical max
   and the reason a frozen domain cannot grow.
2. A cap must satisfy `validate_domain_cap`: it may not exceed the technical
   max, collide with a partition stride/sentinel, or overflow a fixed record
   capacity. Invalid caps fail at generation (Python) and, where the cap is
   compiled in, at compile time via the static assertions in `include/id_space.h`.
3. Class cannot be raised past 0x7F without changing the 7-bit `jid` save
   bitfield -- that requires a save layout/epoch change and is out of scope
   here (see the closure report non-goals).

## Item expansion pilot: 0xCD -> 0xCE

The item domain is the worked, real end-to-end expansion. It is opt-in and
default-disabled so vanilla/archival output stays byte-for-byte compatible.

- Default (no override): item cap is 0xCD, the 206 vanilla records generate,
  and the generated `gItemData[]` round-trips byte-for-byte against
  `src/data_items.c`.
- Opt-in: set `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE` (up to 0xFF). Generation then merges the
  overlay `src/data/items_expansion.json`, the enum constant in
  `include/constants/items_expansion.h` becomes resolvable, and
  `gItemData[]` emits the `[ITEM_EXPANSION_CE]` record with
  `#include "constants/items_expansion.h"`.
- An expansion record referenced without opting in is rejected early with an
  actionable diagnostic (`... beyond the configured item cap 0xCD; raise
  FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP to opt this ID in`).

### Why 0xCE is safe with zero layout change

The item save fields are already 14-bit (`GameSavePackedUnit.item1..item5`,
mask 0x3FFF) and 16-bit (`SuspendSavePackedUnit.item1..item3`); the runtime
index is masked to 8 bits (`ITEM_INDEX`); event operand lanes are 16-bit; the
unit inventory slots are `u16`. So 0xCE (and any ID up to 0xFF) round-trips
bit-exactly through save, suspend, and multi-arena/link representations with
no serialized layout, meaning, packing, checksum, or epoch change. The only
cost of 0xCD -> 0xCE is one extra `struct ItemData` record in ROM.

### Item expansion is modern-only; the archival lane is vanilla-cap-only

Item ID expansion is a **modern-lane-only** capability. Only the modern GCC
build threads the cap into the compile (`modern.mk` appends
`-DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=<n>` to `MODERN_DEFINE_FLAGS`), so the generated (up to
207-record) `gItemData[]` table and the compiled `ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP`
consumer resolve one identical cap.

The archival agbcc lane is **unsupported for expansion** and does not thread
`-DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP`. At a non-vanilla cap it would silently plan an expanded
table while every archival object still compiles the built-in vanilla `0xCD`
cap: a generated-vs-compiled contract divergence.

The guard is enforced by **two complementary gates** that share one
actionable diagnostic (`GENERATED_DATA_ARCHIVAL_ITEM_CAP_DIAG`, defined once in
`generated_data.mk` so they cannot drift):

* **Gate 1 -- parse-time known-goal fast-fail.** For an explicitly-named public
  archival goal, the `Makefile` filters `$(MAKECMDGOALS)` against
  `ARCHIVAL_KNOWN_GOALS` (the `legacy` alias, the direct ROM/ELF/MAP products,
  `fireemblem8_relocs.elf`, `objects.lst`, and the whole
  `shiftcheck{,-static,-offsets,-diff,-run}` family) and, at an expanded cap,
  fires a `$(error)` during **parse** -- before any recipe, sub-make
  (`$(MAKE) -C mgfembp ...`), or agbcc compile is even planned. This is what
  makes a real `make legacy` / `make fireemblem8.gba` fail *early*: it must not
  first churn mgfembp's sub-build and hundreds of agbcc objects (all regular
  prerequisites of `$(ROM)`, updated before an order-only prerequisite) only to
  abort at the final link.
* **Gate 2 -- dependency-graph backstop.** `generated_data.mk` defines a single
  `.PHONY` guard target whose *recipe* body is a make `$(error)`, and the
  `Makefile` attaches it as an order-only prerequisite of the archival
  link/list/artifact products -- `objects.lst`, `fireemblem8.elf`,
  `fireemblem8.gba`, `fireemblem8.map`, and `fireemblem8_relocs.elf`. Every
  archival artifact funnels through at least one of these, so **any** target
  not on the Gate-1 list -- an indirect entry, or a target added later that
  merely depends on an archival product -- still inherits the guard through the
  graph, with no goal list to maintain. Because the assertion is a make
  function in the recipe body, it fires at plan/expansion time, so even a dry
  run exits non-zero (a plain recipe-level check would never run under
  `make -n`).

```console
$ FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make -n legacy      # Gate 1 (any known goal): parse-time
Makefile:NNN: *** Archival lane (the agbcc fireemblem8.gba/.elf/.map ROM/ELF/MAP,
the `legacy` alias, fireemblem8_relocs.elf, the shiftcheck family, and
objects.lst) only supports the vanilla item cap FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCD, but
FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP='0xCE' resolved to 0xCE. The agbcc archival lane does not thread
-DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP, so an expanded cap would generate a table that diverges from
the compiled ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP. Item ID expansion is modern-only: build the
modern lane instead, e.g. `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make expansion-modern-boot-check
MODERN_CONFIG=release MODERN_ABI=aapcs`; or unset FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP (or set it to
0xCD) to build this archival target.  Stop.

# An ad-hoc/indirect target that merely depends on an archival product, named
# nowhere in ARCHIVAL_KNOWN_GOALS, is still blocked by Gate 2 (generated_data.mk).
```

The guard compares the *normalized, validated* resolved cap
(`scripts/generated_data/idspace.py resolve_item_id_cap` vs `ITEM_DEFAULT_CAP`),
honors both environment and `make FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=... <goal>` command-line
overrides (command line wins), and accepts any legal spelling of the vanilla
cap (`0xCD`, `205`, `0xcd`, `0o315`). The attachment is deliberately at the
link/list/artifact boundary rather than on the individual objects: several
`src/data/*.o` data objects are *shared* -- the modern lane's
`expansion-modern-boot-check` builds them through its own `make NODEP=0
<objects>` sub-make -- so guarding objects would wrongly block the modern lane,
whereas the archival products are produced only by the agbcc lane. Migration
impact: to build an expanded item ROM, use the modern lane; the archival lane
is vanilla-`0xCD`-only. A bare `make` (modern), the modern targets, and
`FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make generated-data-check` (which build only their own /
generated objects) are unaffected.

## Adding a supported item record

1. Add the enum constant to `include/constants/items_expansion.h`.
2. Add the record to `src/data/items_expansion.json`. **Do not append a
   message to `texts/texts.txt` for it.** That table is Huffman-compressed
   as one shared blob, so one added message re-encodes the text blob of
   *every* build -- including default, feature-free ones -- which this
   repository treats as a default-identity regression, not a cost of doing
   business. Leave `nameTextId`/`descTextId`/`useDescTextId` unset (they
   stay `0`); never reuse a vanilla message index, name or icon design as a
   shortcut, and do not add new graphics assets: point `iconId` at an
   existing neutral slot and document the choice. The bundled issue #6
   example (`ITEM_EXPANSION_CE`) is the worked reference for authoring the
   record's *original* display text through the config-gated content path:
   put it in the record as `"authoringName": "..."`, which
   `scripts/generated_data/items/content_text.py` emits into a build-local
   text table that only an `EXPANSION_STARTER_CONTENT=1` build generates and
   links -- see `docs/starter_features.md`, "Config-gated content text".
3. Raise `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP` to at least the new ID.
4. Regenerate and test (no `--no-roundtrip`: the vanilla 206-record round
   trip stays fully enforced; overlay-only IDs are verified separately):
   - `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE make -f generated_data.mk generated-data-check`
     (opt-in gate: validates 207 records, keeps the archival inventory/manifest
     at 206, exits 0)
   - `make -f generated_data.mk generated-data-check` (default gate stays
     vanilla-clean at 206)
   - `python3 -m unittest scripts.generated_data.tests.test_items_expansion
     scripts.generated_data.tests.test_items_roundtrip_regression`

The compiled consumer sees the same cap: `include/id_space.h` emits
`ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP` as `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP` (default `0xCD`), the modern
build passes `-DFE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=<n>` (see `modern.mk`), and `src/bmitem.c`
includes `id_space.h` with a compile-time `ITEM_ID_CONFIGURED_CAP <=
ITEM_ID_TECHNICAL_MAX` assertion, so a stray `0x100` fails the compile.

## Runtime probe (`expansion-modern-itemexpansion-check`)

The host tests above model the ID space; this gate proves it inside a real,
booted expansion ROM. `src/expansion_itemtest.c` (opt-in, gated by
`FE8_EXPANSION_ITEMTEST_ENABLED`, default 0) sequences *production* calls and
records what they returned into `gItemExpansionProbe`; it re-implements
nothing. `tools/gba-playtest/run_item_expansion_checks.py` resolves that
symbol's address from the linked ELF, replays a scripted scenario through
libmGBA and asserts every recorded value.

```sh
FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE FE8_EXPANSION_ITEMTEST=1 \
  make expansion-modern-itemexpansion-check MODERN_CONFIG=debug MODERN_ABI=aapcs -j"$(nproc)"
FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE FE8_EXPANSION_ITEMTEST=1 \
  make expansion-modern-itemexpansion-check MODERN_CONFIG=release MODERN_ABI=aapcs -j"$(nproc)"
```

Every expected record value is read from the authored source of truth
(`src/data/items_expansion.json` resolved through the generated-data schema,
plus the `MSG_*`/`ITYPE_*`/`IA_*` headers), never restated as a literal in the
runner, so ROM-vs-data drift fails the gate. The runner also cross-checks the
running ROM's compiled cap against the build-local `id_space_active.h`
ACTIVE contract (`--active-header`), binding the runtime, the generated table
and the compiler cap together: cap `0xCE`, 207 records.

Adding `EXPANSION_STARTER_CONTENT=1 EXPANSION_MECHANICS_HOOKS=1
EXPANSION_MECHANICS_SAMPLE=1` to the same command (what CI does) additionally
proves the issue #6 bundled content example on this same single ROM build --
no second harness and no extra build. See `docs/starter_features.md`.

What the debug run proves, all with the authored `0xCE` record and with the
legacy `0xCD` and the empty (`0x0000`) slot unchanged beside it:

| Stage | Production path exercised | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| item record | `GetItemData` / `MakeNewItem` / `GetItemIndex` / `GetItemUses` | every field of the authored `ITEM_EXPANSION_CE` record (`number`, `weaponType`, `maxUses`, `attributes`, `iconId`, `nameTextId`, `descTextId`) and `MakeNewItem = uses<<8 \| id` |
| event | a real `SVAL`+`GIVEITEMTO` script through `CallEvent` -> the engine's own `EV_CMD_GIVEITEM` handler -> the "got item" popup | Eirika's live inventory slot holds the authored item halfword; the same script's `0xCD` item holds `0x00CD` |
| UI | `GetItemName` / `GetItemIconId` / `GetItemDescId`, `DrawItemMenuLine`, `DrawItemStatScreenLine` | name resolves to a real string; icon/name/uses tiles written into the live BG0 tilemap; both draw paths place the same icon |
| link / MultiArena | `WriteMultiArenaSaveTeam` -> `ReadMultiArenaSaveTeam` (through real SRAM) | the authored item halfword, bit-exact |
| game save | `WriteGameSavePackedUnit` -> `LoadSavedUnit` | bit-exact, and the packed 14-bit field itself reads it back |
| suspend save | `EncodeSuspendSavePackedUnit` -> `ReadSuspendSavePackedUnit` | bit-exact |
| content (issue #6) | the public `ExpansionMechanicsApplyBattleStats()` seam on two production-initialized `struct BattleUnit`s | the bundled mechanic's bounded bonus for the item's bearer only; a deployed control unit that does not carry it gets `+0` |

The whole-block save/suspend cycle (manual Suspend through the ordinary Map
Menu, soft reset, Resume) is separately verified on the same expanded-cap ROM
by `expansion-modern-savefmt-check`, which passes at `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE`
for both configurations. The probe deliberately does not add a
`WriteGameSave`-class call site to `src/` (see the baseline recorded in
`tools/gba-playtest/tests/test_savesuspend_resume_scenario.py`).

### Release-configuration limitation

`MODERN_CONFIG=release` runs the same probe with `--require-stages boot`: the
running release ROM's own `GetItemData`/`MakeNewItem`/`GetItemIndex`/
`GetItemUses` are asserted to resolve `0xCE` to the expanded record with
`0xCD` unchanged -- plus, when the content profile is on, the whole issue #6
config/registry half (the compiled content flag, the typed bundled item ID,
and both mechanics registered through the public API). The map-dependent
stages are proven on the debug ROM.

The reason is a pre-existing property of the release configuration, not of the
ID space: a modern release ROM does not reach a battle map in this headless
harness at all. Reproduced with a *plain release ROM containing no probe code*,
driven through the ordinary New Game route with A/L/direction input for 29000
frames: the world map stays alive (`GmapCursor`, `Gmap MU prim`,
`Gmap Line Fade` procs) and `gProc_BMapMain` never starts. The repository's
own committed release scenarios likewise stop at title/save-menu depth, and
the deep Chapter 2 scenarios (`debugtools-*`, `savesuspend-resume`) are
debug-only. Investigating that release-build world-map stall is out of scope
for issue #10 and is reported as a separate finding.

Re-assessed against the finalized issue #13 runtime harness when that harness
was merged into this branch, rather than carried forward on the earlier
wording:

* The only release-config production entry that harness ships is
  `new-game.json` / `expansion-modern-newgame-check MODERN_CONFIG=release`,
  and it ends at the ordinary Save Menu -> New Game -> Easy -> first empty
  slot write. Its last checkpoint is frame 1400, before any chapter or
  battle map exists.
* Every scenario in that harness which does reach a live map (`combat.json`,
  `save-load.json`, `debugtools-ch4-prep-positive-modern-debug.json`) is
  gated `ifeq ($(MODERN_CONFIG),debug)` in `modern.mk`, because each boots
  through a debug-only launcher or selector. The release mirrors
  (`debugtools-tools-modern-release`,
  `debugtools-selector-modern-release`) exist precisely to prove those
  tools are compiled out of a release ROM, so neither can serve as a release
  map entry.
* Reusing the release New Game entry was attempted, not assumed: the
  committed `new-game.json` frame script extended with ordinary A
  confirmations (frames 1300..30000, period 30) and L world-map cursor jumps
  (frames 2000..30000, period 300), replayed against a freshly built plain
  release ROM containing no probe code, still leaves the first word of
  `gPlaySt` and both `struct Unit` character/class pointers of
  `gUnitArrayBlue[0]` at zero on frame 30000 -- no chapter, no map, no unit.
* The probe ROM itself was re-run fresh on the merged tree. `--frame 45000`
  (over twice the gate window) and a five-times denser world-map input script
  both end with `stagesCompleted=0x1`, `mapMainSeen=0`, `playerPhaseSeen=0`,
  `wmLocation=0x1` and `phaseTimedOut=0x1`. The identical input script and
  probe on the debug ROM reach `stagesCompleted=0x3F`, `mapMainSeen=1` and
  `playerPhaseSeen=1`.

`--require-stages boot` therefore stays the honest release contract: it is
not raised to a stage set the release ROM cannot actually and repeatably
reach.

### Layout note for expanded-cap ROMs

Growing `gItemData[]` moves every ROM object placed after it. The committed
deep-runtime fingerprints (`debugtools-hub`, `debugtools-map-hub`, ...) probe
absolute ROM pointers that live in EWRAM at fixed addresses, so they are
default-cap oracles by construction and are not run against a 0xCE ROM. The
layout-tolerant official gates are run at 0xCE instead (boot, title, shifted
boot/title at `MODERN_SHIFT_AMOUNT=0x40000`, save-format, budget, overlay
audit), and this probe resolves its own symbol from the ELF so it pins no
layout at all.

## Migration impact

None for the item pilot: no serialized save layout, meaning, packing,
checksum, or epoch changes. Legacy decoders keep reading old values. Widening
class/chapter/unit is deliberately NOT done here; those require a versioned
save/runtime change and a future epoch bump, documented as non-goals in
`reports/issue10_closure.md`.

## Tester-facing procedure

[`TC-CORE-005`](test-cases/core-framework.md#tc-core-005-typed-id-cap-preserves-default-boundary)
covers DEFAULT versus ACTIVE contracts, the `0xCE` item route, default-cap
and archival refusal controls, and the save-neutral pilot boundary.
