# Full-game locale source imports

`texts/locales/` contains deterministic, UTF-8 source imports for full-game
Japanese (`ja`) and Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`) localization. Verified
FE8U-target decisions feed the opt-in modern game catalog; raw-address values
remain import provenance only and never become runtime keys.

## Layout and provenance

- `source/fe8j/jp_texts.txt`, `source/fe8j/jp_textdefs.txt`,
  `source/fe8j/msg_map.tsv`, and `source/fe8cn/FE8CN.txt`: byte-exact,
  hash-pinned authorized input snapshots. These committed raw files are the
  independent regeneration source.
- `ja/indexed.txt`: 3,339 FE8J-layout messages (`0x0000` through `0x0D0A`).
- `ja/control_defs.txt`: FE8J source aliases mapped to canonical controls. It is
  an alias table, not normalized locale payload.
- `ja/raw.json`: 116 materialized FE8J raw-symbol providers keyed by FE8U
  target ID plus the verified evidence symbol. This includes the three
  inline goal-window labels and prevents a same-number FE8J indexed message
  from being substituted for a raw provider.
- `zh-Hans/indexed.txt`: 3,339 FE8CN messages using the FE8J indexed layout.
- `zh-Hans/raw.json`: 152 raw-address occurrences deduplicated to 143 stable
  `fe8cn.raw.import-NNNN` IDs. IDs are assigned by pinned source import order,
  not ROM address. Address, source lines, and duplicate occurrences exist only
  under each record's `provenance` field.
- `mapping/fe8j_to_fe8u.candidates.json`: a sparse import of the supplied
  `msg_map.tsv`. It is explicitly `candidate`, `authoritative: false`, and
  unverified.
- `mapping/fe8u_structural_evidence.json`: hash-pinned evidence harvested from
  matching named FE8U/FE8J structures. Each slot records its subsystem,
  evidence kind, table/symbol/key, confidence, source paths, and rationale.
  A Japanese `literal` provider additionally names an existing tracked C
  source file, table symbol, `message_id=0xNNNN` key, and bounded initializer
  context SHA-256. Validation opens the source and requires the keyed entry's
  exact literal and fingerprint to match.
- `mapping/fe8u_target_map.json`: the authoritative 3,414-row FE8U target
  decision ledger generated from the committed evidence. Every row is indexed,
  raw, authored, or an explicit English fallback.
- `mapping/fe8u_target_map.coverage.json`: deterministic source-kind and
  subsystem counts plus every fallback target ID and reason.
- `mapping/raw_surface_decisions.json`: the 29 audited records that were not
  part of the original 114 raw-to-game-ID mappings. Each has a concrete game
  message ID, semantic expansion key, explicit English fallback, or documented
  exclusion and call-site anchors.
- `mapping/raw_surface_closure.json`: deterministic 143-record closure
  manifest. It is rebuilt from the raw source, verified FE8U map, deferred
  decisions, expansion registry/catalogs, and live source anchors.
- `manifest.json`: pinned input SHA-256 hashes, artifact hashes, exact counts,
  locale IDs, codepoint counts, and maximum UTF-8 payload lengths.

FE8J source IDs are not FE8U target IDs. The FE8U target universe has 3,414
IDs, while the indexed FE8J layout has 3,339. Candidate rows must therefore
remain unresolved until semantic verification produces an authoritative
mapping.

## Canonical controls

Normalized payload has one accepted control spelling:

```text
[CTRL:HHHH]
```

`HHHH` is exactly four uppercase hexadecimal digits representing one u16
control unit. The importer converts FE8J `[$HHHH]`, FE8CN `[0xHHH]` /
`[0xHHHH]`, and pinned named aliases to that form. Unknown, malformed, mixed,
or bare marker-like tokens such as `[0001]` are rejected rather than retained
as text. `scripts.localization.game_locales` exports APIs to expand a
canonical token to its exact u16 value and little-endian bytes.

## Regeneration and check

Regenerate only when intentionally refreshing normalized outputs:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales regenerate
```

The required source-of-truth gate regenerates every artifact and the manifest
from the committed raw snapshots in memory, then compares committed output
byte-for-byte:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales check
```

This check does not trust artifact hashes recorded by the committed manifest,
so changing an artifact and its manifest entry together still fails. The four
raw snapshots must also match the independent SHA-256 pins in
`scripts/localization/game_locales/importer.py`.

The explicit `import` command remains available for checking prospective
external replacements, but it accepts only inputs matching those pins.

## Structural mapping methodology

Mappings are promoted only by an independent semantic key shared by the FE8U
and FE8J references. Current evidence families are:

- character, class, and item row keys plus the corresponding name,
  description, and use-text fields;
- chapter `internalName` plus title/objective/goal fields;
- support `(character A, character B, rank)` slots;
- matching named event/world-map scripts plus text ordinal, including reviewed
  raw event opcodes;
- menu table symbol plus override ID/row, with direct regional strings keyed by
  stable `fe8cn.raw.import-NNNN` IDs;
- terrain enum index;
- battle/defeat table keys decoded from the named ROM structures.

The candidate seed is consulted only to record whether an independently proven
decision agrees with it. `interp`, `extrap`, shifted, or identity candidates
cannot create a release mapping. Split/merge cases remain explicit evidence
gaps; for example the two Chapter 14B scenes are not ordinal-mapped. The shared
Duessel/Knoll support key proves FE8U `0x0D49`-`0x0D4B` maps to FE8J
`0x0D08`-`0x0D0A`.

Maintainers may refresh the evidence from the authorized reference trees:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales harvest-crosswalk \
  --fe8u-root /path/to/fireemblem8u \
  --fe8j-root /path/to/fireemblem8j
```

Normal validation does not require those trees. It rebuilds only from committed
evidence and compares the release artifacts byte-for-byte:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales build-crosswalk
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales check-crosswalk
```

The committed FE8U target report currently contains 3,414 decisions and zero
unresolved:

- 1,472 verified indexed mappings;
- 136 verified raw target mappings, covering 137 raw import records because
  the two Attack pointers intentionally share FE8U message ID `0x067B`;
- 0 authored translations;
- 1,806 explicit English fallbacks.

Translation coverage is therefore 1,608 targets (47.10%). Explicit fallback
coverage is 1,806 targets (52.90%); fallback content is not translated content.
The largest reported gap is 1,794 `not-yet-verified` targets, chiefly dialogue
outside the proven named structures. Other fallback reasons are `dummy` (1),
`region-only` (1), and `expansion-only` (10).

## Raw-surface closure

The closure ledger accounts for all 143 unique raw imports:

- 137 records resolve through stable FE8U game message IDs;
- 6 records use semantic expansion keys: 2 distinct commands that share FE8U
  ID `0x0693`, 3 promotion-selector initializer providers, and 1 diagnostic
  build timestamp;
- the command keys are
  (`raw_surface.unit_action.summon` and
  `raw_surface.unit_action.call_monster`);
- the goal-window records use FE8J inline raw symbols `GoalString_UnitsLeft`,
  `GoalString_Turn`, and `GoalString_LastTurn`, bound to FE8U `0x01C1`-
  `0x01C3`; they never use unrelated same-number FE8J indexed messages;
- every record resolves to nonempty Japanese and Simplified Chinese payloads;
- 0 records use fallback or exclusion;
- 0 records remain unresolved.

Japanese raw providers comprise 20 literals verified directly against tracked
FE8J-derived C table entries and 116 materialized target+symbol records in
`ja/raw.json`. Simplified Chinese comes from the exact imported raw payload.
Modern promotion-selector initializers are empty because their draw callback
normally supplies a localized class name. If a bounded option target or its
name message is absent/invalid, the callback consumes the option's localized
semantic key as a fallback; legacy keeps the original Japanese initializer
bytes. The modern timestamp diagnostic resolves through the expansion locale
accessor, but every runtime locale duplicates this executable's current
`gBuildDateTime`. The imported FE8CN 2004 timestamp remains raw-source
provenance only; legacy keeps printing `gBuildDateTime`.

Build or check the machine report:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales build-raw-closure
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales check-raw-closure
```

The check also verifies every recorded FE8U source path and anchor still
exists, every literal provider matches its committed symbol/key/value/context,
every raw symbol has a matching target+symbol materialization, every semantic
expansion key is active and translated in `en`/`ja`/`zh-Hans`, and every
expansion provider names a surviving runtime consumer function whose body
contains the key-specific resolver anchors. Chinese expansion values equal
their imported raw payload except executable-identity records, whose
`en`/`ja`/`zh-Hans` values must all equal the referenced C string symbol. Its
strict gate is exactly 143 total, 143 verified game/expansion providers, 143
materialized JA payloads, 143 materialized ZH payloads, and zero fallback,
exclusions, or unresolved records.

## Mapping validation and coverage

```bash
python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales validate-mapping \
  --mapping texts/locales/mapping/fe8u_target_map.json

python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales coverage \
  --locale ja \
  --mapping texts/locales/mapping/fe8u_target_map.json
```

Coverage classifications are `indexed_source`, `raw_source`,
`authored_translation`, `explicit_english_fallback`, and `unresolved`.
The release report further groups them by structural subsystem. Candidate rows
remain unresolved when validating the candidate file itself; only a
schema-valid verified mapping backed by committed evidence contributes release
coverage.
