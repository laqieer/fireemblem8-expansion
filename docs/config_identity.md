# Framework configuration and ROM identity (issue #8)

This document is the single reference for the expansion framework's
configuration surface: the committed `config.mk` defaults, the optional
Autoconf-generated `config.autotools.mk` overrides, the
`MODERN_CONFIG`/`MODERN_ABI`/`MODERN_ROM_SIZE`/`MODERN_TEXT_SHIFT` build
presets, the deterministic per-build metadata generated under `build/`,
the embedded `ExpansionMetadata` record in every modern ROM, and exactly
which settings are compatibility-relevant (fold into the config
fingerprint) and why. It only covers the **modern** (GCC-based) build
path; the legacy agbcc build is unaffected and keeps its hardcoded
defaults (see "Legacy build path" below).

## Settings reference

### GNU Autoconf front end

Run `./configure --help` to see the persistent feature/profile interface.
`configure` validates the selected combination with the same
`scripts/modernize/expansion_config.py` implementation used by the build, then
writes ignored `config.autotools.mk` and `GNUmakefile` files. Supported options
cover the starter flags, AoE reference, casual-mode policy, HQ mixer,
localized-text auto-wrap, enabled/default/pseudo locales, ROM size, item ID
cap, and link-time text shift.

Only options explicitly passed to `configure` are written, so unspecified
settings continue to use `config.mk`/`modern.mk` defaults. Precedence is:

1. an explicit `make VAR=value` for one invocation;
2. an explicit `./configure` option persisted in `config.autotools.mk`;
3. an environment value or committed `config.mk`/`modern.mk` default.

The generated GNUmakefile forwards all goals to the committed Make backend,
including from a separate configure directory. The backend still owns the
specialized ROM, asset, linker, and runtime-gate recipes. `make distclean`
removes generated Autoconf state. Contributors changing `configure.ac` must
regenerate the committed `configure` script with `autoreconf -fi`.

### `config.mk` (root, committed)

| Setting | Constraint | Default | Affects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EXPANSION_VERSION_MAJOR` | integer, `[0, 255]` | `0` | framework version (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_VERSION_MINOR` | integer, `[0, 255]` | `1` | framework version (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_VERSION_PATCH` | integer, `[0, 255]` | `0` | framework version (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_ROM_TITLE` | up to 12 printable-ASCII bytes | `FIREEMBLEM2E` | ROM header, embedded metadata (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_ROM_GAME_CODE` | exactly 4 printable-ASCII bytes | `BE8E` | ROM header, embedded metadata (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_ROM_MAKER_CODE` | exactly 2 printable-ASCII bytes | `01` | ROM header, embedded metadata (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_ROM_REVISION` | integer, `[0, 255]` | `0` | ROM header "software version" byte (fingerprint) |
| `EXPANSION_BUILD_ID` | empty, or 4-40 hex characters | empty | embedded build commit override |
| `EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH` | integer, `[0, 65535]` | `2` | save-format compatibility gate (see `docs/save_format.md`); **not** part of the fingerprint above |
| `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` | comma-separated subset of `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it`, `qps-ploc`; must include `en`; enabling any real non-English locale requires `MODERN_ROM_SIZE=32M` | `en` | issue #18 localization (fingerprint) -- which locale profile this ROM enables |
| `EXPANSION_DEFAULT_LOCALE` | must be a member of `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` | `en` | issue #18 localization (fingerprint) -- the locale `src/expansion_locale.c`'s runtime resolver starts in |
| `EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE` | `0` or `1`; must be `1` if and only if `qps-ploc` is in `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` | `0` | issue #18 localization (fingerprint) -- enables the deterministic ASCII pseudo-locale test harness (`scripts/localization/pseudo.py`), never a real translation |
| `EXPANSION_MECHANICS_HOOKS` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #6 starter feature (fingerprint) -- link the public battle-stat mechanics hook registry |
| `EXPANSION_MECHANICS_SAMPLE` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #6 starter feature (fingerprint) -- register the content-free sample mechanic; requires `EXPANSION_MECHANICS_HOOKS=1` |
| `EXPANSION_DANGER_OVERLAY_MENU` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #6 starter feature (fingerprint) -- expose the player danger/range overlay map-menu surface |
| `EXPANSION_STARTER_CONTENT` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #6 starter feature (fingerprint) -- link the bundled generated-data content example; requires `EXPANSION_MECHANICS_HOOKS=1` **and** an item ID cap reaching `ITEM_EXPANSION_CE` (`FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP=0xCE` or higher) |
| `EXPANSION_AOE_REFERENCE` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #42 optional project-neutral radius-heal reference and semantic probe (fingerprint); the typed AoE core remains available independently and the flag has no dependencies or conflicts |
| `EXPANSION_CUSTOM_SPELL_EFFECTS` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #77 optional typed custom battle spell-effect runtime foundation (fingerprint); preserves vanilla LUT/`SpellAssoc`, has no save impact, and the future #78 adapter owns generated bindings |
| `EXPANSION_CASUAL_MODE` | `0` or `1` | `0` | issue #34 optional ordinary player-defeat restoration (fingerprint); combat/arena defeats are restored at the next chapter boundary, while scripted deaths and explicit removals remain permanent |
| `EXPANSION_HQ_MIXER` | `0` or `1`; only `en` or `en,qps-ploc` locale profiles | `0` | issue #83 optional modern-only high-resolution MP2K PCM mixer (fingerprint); archival and real-localized-game requests fail before compilation and save compatibility is unchanged |
| `EXPANSION_BGM_CONTINUATION_POLICY` | `preserve`, `resume`, or `restart` | `preserve` | issues #37/#39 typed BGM continuation policy (fingerprint); never save-compatible |

Every value has a `?=` default, so an explicit `./configure` option, `make`
command-line override (e.g.
`make expansion-modern-rom EXPANSION_ROM_TITLE=MYHACK`), or environment value
changes the built ROM's identity without editing the file.
`config.mk` deliberately does **not** duplicate `MODERN_CONFIG`,
`MODERN_ABI`, `MODERN_ROM_SIZE`, or `MODERN_TEXT_SHIFT` -- those remain
owned by `modern.mk`, which already had working presets for them before
issue #8; `config.mk` only owns the values that had no committed home
before this issue (semantic version, ROM identity, and the build-id
override).

### `modern.mk` build presets

| Variable | Supported values | Default | Affects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MODERN_CONFIG` | `debug`, `release` | `debug` | optimization/debug info, `NDEBUG`, `FE8_EXPANSION_DEBUG`/`_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED`/`_LOGGING_ENABLED` (fingerprint) |
| `MODERN_ABI` | `aapcs`, `apcs-gnu` | `aapcs` | calling convention / struct layout (fingerprint) |
| `MODERN_ROM_SIZE` | `16M`, `32M`, or an exact byte count equal to one of those | `16M` | output ROM size / padding (fingerprint) |
| `MODERN_TEXT_SHIFT` | non-negative integer, 4-byte aligned | `0` | link-time padding before `.text` (fingerprint) |
| `FE8_ITEM_ID_CAP` | integer, `[0x00, 0xFF]` | `0xCD` | active item table capacity and compiled content boundary (metadata and fingerprint) |

The supported default remains English-only at 16 MiB:

```bash
make expansion-modern-rom
```

The existing ASCII pseudo-locale also remains a valid 16 MiB test profile:

```bash
make expansion-modern-rom \
  EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES=en,qps-ploc \
  EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE=1
```

All real non-English locales are opt-in 32 MiB production profiles:

```bash
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-ja
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-zh-hans
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-ja-zh-hans
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-fr-de-es-it
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-all
```

The complete supported optional-feature composition has a separate,
non-configurable named build/check target:

```bash
make expansion-modern-all-locales-all-features-check
```

It is release/AAPCS-only, uses a private generated-data/output root, and
selects all production locales plus the documented optional features. See
[`patch_release.md`](patch_release.md) for its patch-only artifact contract;
the default build and every existing locale profile remain unchanged.

The named targets use isolated build roots and select their full-game catalog
and localized font payload from the same validated
`EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` profile used for metadata and fingerprinting.
Direct builds may set the same locales plus `MODERN_ROM_SIZE=32M`.
`MODERN_ROM_SIZE=16M` with any real non-English locale is rejected before
compilation.
English-only and English+pseudo remain valid/default at 16 MiB.

`MODERN_ABI=apcs-gnu` is accepted only by the compile-only
`expansion-modern-cohort`/`expansion-modern-all` object targets, for
cross-ABI struct-layout comparison (see
[`docs/save_format.md`](save_format.md#cross-compiler-persisted-struct-layout-compatibility)).
Every target that actually links or produces a ROM --
`expansion-modern-elf`, `-rom`, `-boot-check`, `-linker-check`, and the
targets that depend on them -- requires `MODERN_ABI=aapcs` and fails fast
in `modern.mk` otherwise (see
[`docs/framework-support.md`](framework-support.md#build-targets-and-outputs)'s
"ABI contract" note).

`MODERN_CONFIG=debug` compiles with `-Og -g3` and no `-DNDEBUG`, enabling
`FE8_EXPANSION_DEBUG`/`FE8_EXPANSION_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED`/
`FE8_EXPANSION_LOGGING_ENABLED` (see "C configuration header" below).
`MODERN_CONFIG=release` compiles with `-O2 -g0 -DNDEBUG`, disabling all
three by default -- this preserves the pre-existing `NDEBUG` convention
already used by `include/gba/isagbprint.h`'s `AGB_ASSERT`/`AGB_WARNING`
macros; subsystems added later should gate development-only code on
`FE8_EXPANSION_DEBUG` rather than re-deriving it from `NDEBUG` themselves.
Issue #68's mGBA logging frontend uses the existing
`FE8_EXPANSION_LOGGING_ENABLED` consequence of this preset directly: it
adds no independent option, Make variable, or identity field. The preset is
already fingerprinted, so debug logging and release omission have distinct,
deterministic ROM identities without changing save compatibility.

Both modern configurations define `BUGFIX=1`, enabling the decompilation's
reviewed correctness fixes alongside `MODERN=1` and `NONMATCHING=1`. The
archival agbcc lane deliberately leaves `BUGFIX` undefined so its original
behavior and byte-identical layout remain unchanged.

## Build-ID resolution (deterministic, no timestamps/branch names)

The embedded build commit is resolved with this precedence, entirely in
`scripts/modernize/expansion_config.py`'s `resolve_build_commit()`:

1. **Explicit override** -- `EXPANSION_BUILD_ID` in `config.mk`, or a
   `make ... EXPANSION_BUILD_ID=...`/environment override. Must be 4-40
   hex characters (a git commit SHA or a SHA prefix); this is enforced by
   `validate_build_id_override()`, which rejects anything else (including
   timestamps and branch names) with an actionable error.
2. **`git rev-parse HEAD`**, run with `cwd` set to the repository root.
   This resolves identically for a normal branch checkout and a detached
   HEAD (e.g. a CI checkout of a tag or PR merge commit), so no special
   detached-HEAD handling is needed.
3. **`"unknown"` sentinel** -- used when git is unavailable, the checkout
   has no `.git` directory (a downloaded source archive/tarball), or `git
   rev-parse` otherwise fails. This is the only fallback; the build never
   substitutes a timestamp, branch name, or host path.

## Deterministic per-build metadata

Every modern build resolves and validates the full identity, then
generates:

```
build/expansion-modern/<MODERN_CONFIG>/<MODERN_ABI>/generated/expansion_build_metadata.json
build/expansion-modern/<MODERN_CONFIG>/<MODERN_ABI>/generated/expansion_build_metadata.mk
```

Both are **generated build outputs**, never committed source -- they live
entirely under `build/`, are regenerated by
`scripts/modernize/expansion_config.py generate`, and are only rewritten
when their content actually changes (so an unrelated rebuild does not
touch their mtimes). The `.json` file is the canonical machine-readable
record (also consumed by `finalize_rom_header.py` and
`verify_rom_header.py`); the `.mk` file feeds `MODERN_BUILD_COMMIT`,
`MODERN_CONFIG_FINGERPRINT`, `MODERN_VERSION_PACKED`, and
`MODERN_VERSION_STRING` back into `modern.mk` for use in `MODERN_CFLAGS`
`-D` defines.

## The config identity fingerprint

`compute_fingerprint()` produces the first 16 hex characters of a
SHA-256 digest over a canonical (sorted-key, fixed-separator) JSON
encoding of the fields returned by `ExpansionIdentity.fingerprint_fields()`.
Because the encoding is canonical, identical inputs always produce the
same fingerprint on any host, and the fingerprint only changes when a
compatibility-relevant setting changes.

**Compatibility-relevant settings folded into the fingerprint** (and why):

| Field | Why it is compatibility-relevant |
| --- | --- |
| `version` (major/minor/patch) | marks an intentional framework/config-identity change |
| `abi` | affects calling convention and struct layout (ABI compatibility) |
| `config_preset` | debug vs. release changes optimization, assertions, and logging -- runtime behavior differs |
| `rom_size_bytes` | affects ROM data layout/padding |
| `text_shift` | affects link-time ROM layout |
| `rom_title`, `rom_game_code`, `rom_maker_code`, `rom_revision` | ROM identity; changing these produces a distinguishable ROM (e.g. for emulator save matching, patch tooling) |
| `enabled_locales`, `default_locale`, `pseudo_locale_enabled` | issue #18 localization settings; the enabled set is normalized into stable locale-ID order before hashing, so equivalent input orders share a fingerprint while different locale profiles do not. Diagnostic/UI identity only -- see `docs/localization.md`; never touches the save format (`EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH` stays independent, see below) |
| `features.mechanics_hooks`, `features.mechanics_sample`, `features.danger_overlay_menu`, `features.starter_content` | issue #6 starter-feature opt-ins; each links different code and/or data, so two builds that differ in any of them are behaviourally distinguishable. Diagnostic identity only -- see `docs/starter_features.md`; none of them touches the save format |
| `features.aoe_reference` | issue #42 default-off reference effect/probe; changes runtime behavior only when explicitly invoked. Diagnostic identity only -- see `docs/aoe.md`; it does not touch the save format |
| `features.custom_spell_effects`, enabled `custom_spell_effect_contract.runtime_abi`, `inventory_digest`, and `resource_budget_digest` | issue #77 default-off custom battle spell-effect runtime; enabled identity binds the public ABI, synthetic descriptor inventory, and published resource envelope. Disabled metadata records zero ABI and SHA-256-of-empty inventory/resource digests without adding that contract tuple to the fingerprint, so the default fingerprint remains unchanged. Diagnostic identity only -- see `docs/custom_spell_effects.md`; it does not touch the save format |
| `features.casual_mode` | issue #34 changes defeat handling and therefore runtime behavior. Its marker uses existing serialized unit-state capacity; no save struct or compatibility epoch changes |
| `features.hq_mixer` | issue #83 selects a different default-off PCM mixer implementation, which changes runtime audio behavior and linked resources but never save layout or the compatibility epoch |
| `item_id_cap` | changes the active generated item table and whether expansion content can compile, so builds with different caps must never share an identity |

Settings that are **not** folded into the fingerprint (e.g. the resolved
`build_commit`) are informational only: two builds from different commits
but with identical compatibility-relevant settings share a fingerprint,
since the commit does not by itself imply an incompatible change. Save
data compatibility is intentionally out of scope for this fingerprint;
`EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH` (see table above) is issue #2 slice 1's
independent save-compatibility key -- see `docs/save_format.md` for the
on-media format it gates and exactly when to bump it. It is deliberately
excluded from `fingerprint_fields()`: this fingerprint is allowed to
contain diagnostics-only settings (like `config_preset`'s debug/release
choice) that must never make an otherwise-identical save look
incompatible, so save compatibility needed its own, narrower key.

## C configuration header

`include/expansion_config.h` is C89/agbcc-safe and reachable from any
translation unit that includes `global.h` first (this repository's
existing include convention). It defines:

- `FE8_EXPANSION` -- unconditional marker that a translation unit is part
  of the expansion framework.
- `FE8_EXPANSION_VERSION_MAJOR`/`_MINOR`/`_PATCH`/`_STRING`/`_PACKED` --
  semantic version components, string, and the packed
  `(major << 16) | (minor << 8) | patch` value.
- `FE8_EXPANSION_BUILD_COMMIT`, `FE8_EXPANSION_CONFIG_FINGERPRINT`,
  `FE8_EXPANSION_CONFIG_PRESET`, `FE8_EXPANSION_ABI` -- deterministic
  build metadata.
- `FE8_EXPANSION_ROM_TITLE`/`_GAME_CODE`/`_MAKER_CODE`/`_REVISION`/
  `_SIZE_BYTES` -- ROM identity.
- `FE8_EXPANSION_DEBUG`, `FE8_EXPANSION_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED`,
  `FE8_EXPANSION_LOGGING_ENABLED` -- release-aware switches for later
  subsystems, derived from `NDEBUG` by default.

Every macro has a hardcoded `#ifndef` fallback matching `config.mk`'s own
defaults exactly, so a legacy agbcc/old_agbcc build -- which never
receives the modern build's `-D` flags -- keeps today's exact ROM
identity and behavior unchanged. The modern build supplies every one of
these as a `-D` command-line define (see `modern.mk`'s "Framework
configuration and ROM identity" section), computed from `config.mk` plus
`MODERN_CONFIG`/`MODERN_ABI`/`MODERN_ROM_SIZE` and the resolved build
commit/fingerprint, so the `#ifndef` fallback is never reached for a
modern build.

## Embedded ROM metadata record

`include/expansion_metadata.h` defines `struct ExpansionMetadata`, and
`src/expansion_metadata.c` defines a single `const` instance
(`gExpansionMetadata`) populated entirely from the `FE8_EXPANSION_*`
macros above, marked so it is linked into every modern ROM's `.rodata`
(not just present in a generated header that never reaches the binary).
The record begins with the fixed 4-byte magic `"FE8M"`, followed by the
semantic version (components, packed value, and string), the build
commit, the config fingerprint, the config preset, the ABI, and the
configured ROM identity (title, game code, maker code, revision, and ROM
size in bytes) -- so the ROM itself unambiguously exposes its own
framework identity without needing an external metadata file.

`scripts/modernize/verify_rom_header.py` locates this record by scanning
the ROM for the magic bytes (`find_expansion_metadata`), parses it
(`parse_expansion_metadata`), and verifies it against a generated
`expansion_build_metadata.json` (`verify_expansion_metadata`, and the
`verify_rom_header()`'s `expected_metadata` keyword argument / the CLI's
`--metadata-json` flag). A ROM with no embedded record, a truncated
record, or a record whose contents disagree with the expected metadata
fails verification with a specific field-level diagnostic.

## GBA header parameterization and checksum

`scripts/modernize/finalize_rom_header.py` patches a freshly `objcopy`'d
flat ROM image's title (12-byte NUL-padded ASCII), game code (4 ASCII
bytes), maker code (2 ASCII bytes), and revision byte in place, then
recomputes and writes the GBA header complement checksum (the byte at
offset `0xBD`, computed over `0xA0..0xBC`, per the standard GBA header
format). Every field is validated **before** any byte of the ROM is
touched; on any invalid field the script exits non-zero and leaves the
ROM file completely untouched. This runs as part of `modern.mk`'s
`$(MODERN_ROM)` recipe, immediately after `objcopy`, and is immediately
followed by `verify_rom_header.py` re-checking the result (title, game
code, maker code, revision, fixed byte, ROM size, checksum, and the
embedded metadata record); if verification fails, the ROM file is deleted
so a stale, invalid image is never left behind.

This mechanism (generated bytes patched into the ROM image post-link, not
a preprocessed `src/rom_header.s` or a build-time macro) was chosen
because `src/rom_header.s` is the **legacy** header source, consumed by
the legacy agbcc/old_agbcc build and by `make compare`; the modern build
path already produces its own separate flat ROM image via `objcopy` from
the modern ELF (which still carries whatever placeholder identity
`rom_header.s`'s modern-compiled object last had), so patching that
post-link output in place is the smallest, safest change that doesn't
touch the legacy path or `ldscript.txt`.

## Legacy build path

The legacy agbcc/old_agbcc build (`make fireemblem8.gba`) is entirely
unaffected: `src/rom_header.s` keeps its own hardcoded identity, and none
of `config.mk`'s values or `MODERN_CFLAGS`'s `-D` defines reach the
legacy `CFLAGS`. `include/expansion_config.h`'s `#ifndef` fallbacks match
today's legacy identity exactly, so any legacy-built object that happens
to include it (directly or transitively) observes unchanged values.

## Debug and release presets

| | `MODERN_CONFIG=debug` | `MODERN_CONFIG=release` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Optimization / debug info | `-Og -g3` | `-O2 -g0` |
| `NDEBUG` | not defined | defined |
| `FE8_EXPANSION_DEBUG` | `1` | `0` |
| `FE8_EXPANSION_ASSERTIONS_ENABLED` | `1` | `0` |
| `FE8_EXPANSION_LOGGING_ENABLED` | `1` | `0` |
| `config_fingerprint` | distinct from release (preset is compatibility-relevant) | distinct from debug |

Both presets are exercised end-to-end by
`expansion-modern-rom MODERN_CONFIG=debug|release`, each producing a
verified ROM with a distinct, deterministic `config_fingerprint`.

## Validation and failure behavior

`scripts/modernize/expansion_config.py` validates every field (title,
game code, maker code, revision, ROM size, semantic version, build-id
override, preset, ABI, locale/default/pseudo consistency, and the
production locale allowlist, including the CJK 32 MiB requirement) and
rejects any malformed value or
incompatible combination with a specific, actionable `ConfigError` message, entirely
**before** any C/assembly compilation or linking is attempted (`modern.mk`
runs `validate`/`resolve` as part of evaluating the makefile itself, so a
bad value fails the `make` invocation immediately) and before any ROM
byte is patched (`finalize_rom_header.py` validates first, then patches).
Invalid values are never silently normalized or clamped.
