# Project governance

This is the entry point for contribution governance, security reporting,
copyright/provenance boundaries, credits, and the support/compatibility
policy. It links to the deeper, single-source-of-truth documents rather
than duplicating them.

## Contribution governance

The general governance document for issue closure, review enforcement, and the
baseline/fingerprint review process is
[`docs/issue-resolution-policy.md`](issue-resolution-policy.md). For feature
requests and bug fixes, the project-scoped
[`development-workflow`](../.github/skills/development-workflow/SKILL.md) skill
is authoritative wherever generic review or closure guidance conflicts with
it. In summary:

- Issue closure is an evidence-based decision recorded as plain-prose evidence
  in the linked PR/issue (frozen scope, every validation command actually run
  and its result, runtime/playtest evidence when behavior can be affected).
  For features and bug fixes, the project skill is authoritative, requires no
  human review or approval, and permits autonomous merge and closure when
  evidence is complete. There is intentionally no machine-readable evidence
  schema.
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` requests `@laqieer` as reviewer for baseline/
  fingerprint and artifact-governance paths, but **does not by itself
  require or block anything** — only repository branch protection/rulesets
  do that.
- `python3 scripts/artifact_guard.py --revision HEAD` is a structural
  Git-object checker (rejects ROM/ELF/save/savestate/patch/generated
  compressed-asset files and specific root outputs). It is **not** a legal
  or copyright clearance — see "Copyright and provenance" below.
- Use the [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
  checklist shape for every PR.
- Use the structured feature-request and bug-report forms under
  [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/); they require the
  review/triage evidence consumed by the development workflow.

High-risk/large changes also use the
[bounded sibling-family review contract](workflow-pilot.md#sibling-family-review-convergence)
and its [indexed case](test-cases/workflow-governance.md#tc-workflow-review-family-001-expand-valid-findings-across-complete-sibling-families).
One fresh read-only reviewer precedes remote review; actual findings expand
to complete finite source-backed obligations. Third-round architecture holds
never hide existing commits or replace the mandatory final gates.

## Security reporting

This repository does not currently ship a `SECURITY.md`. Do not invent a
contact address or process that isn't backed by a real, checked-in file or
platform feature. **Never disclose a sensitive vulnerability's details in
a public issue, pull request, or pull request review comment** -- every
one of those is world-readable on GitHub by default; "avoid a public
issue" is not satisfied by using a PR comment instead, since that is
equally public. Until a `SECURITY.md` is added:

- If GitHub's private vulnerability reporting is enabled for this
  repository, use it (repository → Security tab → "Report a vulnerability").
  Availability depends on the repository's platform configuration and is
  not guaranteed by this document -- check the Security tab yourself
  rather than assuming it is enabled.
- If it is not enabled (or you cannot tell), do not post sensitive
  vulnerability details anywhere public in this repository. Instead, open
  a minimal, non-sensitive request asking the maintainer (`@laqieer`, the
  sole `CODEOWNERS` entry) to establish or point you to a private
  reporting channel, and withhold the actual sensitive details until a
  private channel is confirmed available.

This document does not create, and must not be read as creating, a
guaranteed private-disclosure email address, contact method, or SLA.

## Copyright and provenance

- **This repository does not currently have a `LICENSE` file.** Do not
  assume, state, or imply any specific license for this codebase in other
  docs; if you need a licensing determination, raise it as its own issue
  rather than relying on silence here.
- `scripts/artifact_guard.py` passing is a **structural-compatibility
  allowance only** — it does not confirm that any tracked asset (including
  `graphics/`, `preview/`, `sound/` source-asset classes it narrowly
  permits) is legally cleared, appropriately licensed, or authorized for
  redistribution. See
  [`docs/issue-resolution-policy.md`](issue-resolution-policy.md#legal-and-copyright-boundary)
  for the exact allow/deny list.
- Wave 0 (the current governance baseline) makes **no** decision about a
  distributable "source release" manifest/allowlist; that is tracked
  separately as issue #9 and is out of scope for this document.
- **Do not commit ROM/GBA files, ELF files, saves/SRAM, savestates,
  patches, or generated compressed asset outputs (`.lz`/`.4bpp`/`.8bpp`/
  `.gbapal`) or root build outputs (`fireemblem8.map`,
  `fireemblem8_relocs.map`, `objects.lst`, `build/`).** These are exactly
  what `scripts/artifact_guard.py` rejects.

## Credits and downstream context

### Project wiki

The [fireemblem8-expansion project wiki](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion/wiki)
is maintained as a concise navigation portal. Its Home page and sidebar link
to the versioned repository documentation; they do not duplicate the full
technical guides. The Markdown files under `docs/` and the repository root
remain authoritative because they are reviewed with source changes and checked
by `scripts/check_docs.py` in CI.

Wiki changes are reviewed manually in the separate
`fireemblem8-expansion.wiki.git` repository. Repository CI does not fetch or
live-check the wiki. The upstream `fireemblem8u` wiki below is a distinct,
historical provenance reference.

Projects that consume this repository's ELF/decomp output:

- [**fe-maps**](https://github.com/laqieer/fe-maps) ([site](https://laqieer.github.io/fe-maps/)) — browsable ROM/RAM data maps extracted with `readelf`/`nm -l`.
- [**FE_GBA_Function_Library**](https://github.com/laqieer/FE_GBA_Function_Library) ([site](https://laqieer.github.io/FE_GBA_Function_Library/)) — cross-game function documentation.
- [**FE-Clib-Decomp**](https://github.com/laqieer/FE-Clib-Decomp) — ROM-hacking linker scripts and Event Assembler defines generated from this repo's ELF.

`[historical upstream]` references — kept for provenance, not authoritative
for this repository:

- [Wiki](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8u/wiki)
- [FE Decomp Portal](https://laqieer.github.io/fe-decomp-portal/)
- [decomp.dev match tracker](https://decomp.dev/laqieer/fireemblem8u/us)

## Support and compatibility policy

- The **supported modern path** (`arm-none-eabi` GCC/AAPCS,
  `expansion-modern-*` targets) is what CI builds and boot-verifies. See
  [`docs/framework-support.md`](framework-support.md) for the exact
  host/toolchain/target matrix.
- The **archival agbcc path** (`make legacy`) is preserved, unbroken, but
  explicitly not the default/supported release lane. See
  [`docs/archival-decomp.md`](archival-decomp.md).
- Compatibility expectations (ABI, struct layout, legacy constraints,
  save-format epoch) differ between the two paths — say which path a
  change targets in issue/PR evidence, per
  [`docs/issue-resolution-policy.md`](issue-resolution-policy.md#supported-modern-path-vs-archival-decomp-path).
- Version-to-version migration guidance (once a versioned release exists)
  follows [`docs/release-migration-template.md`](release-migration-template.md).

## Merged implementation vs. future release scope

Issues **#6**, **#10**, **#11**, **#13**, and **#18** have implementation
merged into the current source tree. This does not close or change any GitHub
issue state; it means their live APIs must be documented and reviewed as
current surfaces. See [`architecture.md`](architecture.md#public-extension-boundaries)
and [`framework-support.md`](framework-support.md#merged-framework-contracts).

Issue **#9** remains future release/migration work. The current repository does
not provide release automation, a tag/changelog policy, versioned artifacts,
or a downstream updater. [`release-migration-template.md`](release-migration-template.md)
is scaffolding only and must not be represented as a current release process.
