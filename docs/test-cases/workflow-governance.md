# Workflow-governance cases

These source-only procedures cover the repository's agent delivery policy.
They exercise documented orchestration contracts without dispatching a
workflow, using credentials, or changing ROM behavior.

## TC-WORKFLOW-CI-WAIT-001: Keep CI waiting centralized and trusted pushes owner-scoped

- **Feature / originating issue:** `workflow-governance` /
  [issue #93](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion/issues/93).
- **Supported configuration or artifact:** clean source checkout with
  Python 3; no GitHub token, active pull request, workflow run, ROM, or
  emulator is required.
- **Prerequisites and clean starting state:** start at the repository root and
  leave the mirrored development-workflow policy files unchanged.

### Actions

1. Inspect the trusted-push and CI-waiting sections in
   `.github/skills/development-workflow/SKILL.md`.
2. Run
   `python3 -m unittest scripts.docs_check_tests.test_development_workflow_skill -v`.
3. Confirm the focused suite exercises its required-policy, forbidden-policy,
   and deliberately unbounded watcher negative fixtures.

### Expected result

The mirrored policy requires implementation subagents to validate and commit
locally, then return for a trusted owner-context push. Dispatch records the
exact candidate SHA/run and returns; exactly one bounded direct watcher owns
each active run; Copilot review monitoring runs concurrently with Build;
reasoning inspection starts only after a terminal result; superseded runs are
cancelled; and post-merge monitoring remains nonblocking. The former Full
Matrix gate is absent because the combined Build owns the complete candidate
gate.

### Negative control

Removing a required dispatch-and-return, single-watcher, concurrent-review,
terminal-only inspection, stale-run cancellation, trusted-push, or combined
Build rule makes the focused suite fail. The suite also rejects stale
implementation-agent push ownership, duplicate/unbounded watcher examples,
privileged `pull_request_target`, weakened approvals, and any restored Full
Matrix wording.

### Interactions and save compatibility

The policy depends on GitHub CLI and the existing shell runtime when used for
real delivery. It conflicts with duplicate polling agents, repeated wakeups,
stale candidate evidence, implementation-agent pushes, and unbounded watcher
loops. The source-only case changes no save, generated data, localization,
ROM/RAM, debug/release, or archival behavior and needs no feature gate.

### Automation

`python3 -m unittest scripts.docs_check_tests.test_development_workflow_skill -v`
validates the mirrored policy, bounded watcher example, trusted-push
ownership, concurrent monitoring, stale cancellation, and combined-Build
replacement of the retired Full Matrix.

### Cleanup and limitations

No cleanup is required. The test validates repository policy text and its
fail-closed fixtures; it does not dispatch or wait for a live GitHub workflow
and does not grant push credentials.

## TC-WORKFLOW-MANUAL-HANDOFF-001: Surface actionable manual testing and resume automatically

- **Feature / originating issue:** `workflow-governance` /
  [issue #169](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion/issues/169).
- **Supported configuration or artifact:** clean source checkout with Python
  3; no GitHub token, active manual hold, ROM, or emulator is required to
  validate the protocol.
- **Prerequisites and clean starting state:** start at the repository root with
  [the canonical JSON contract](../../.github/manual-testing-handoff.json),
  development-workflow skill, contributor guide, this case, and registry
  unchanged.

### Actions

1. Parse `.github/manual-testing-handoff.json` and validate every required key,
   value, enum, boolean, target, comment field, and the separately identified
   positive/control artifact roles with deterministic emulator screenshot or
   synchronized emulator A/V evidence.
2. Exercise the positive issue-only, one-PR, and multiple-open-PR queue shapes,
   using an independent GitHub-linked PR relationship map. Exercise malformed
   label, assignee, relationship, and stale-state controls.
3. Exercise completion cleanup with closed and superseded labeled PR history,
   separate label/assignee cleanup sets, and retained independent ownership.
4. Run
   `python3 -m unittest scripts.docs_check_tests.test_development_workflow_skill -v`.
5. Open the documented queue:
   [`repo:laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion is:open assignee:laqieer label:"waiting-for-manual-testing"`](https://github.com/laqieer/fireemblem8-expansion/issues?q=repo%3Alaqieer%2Ffireemblem8-expansion+is%3Aopen+assignee%3Alaqieer+label%3A%22waiting-for-manual-testing%22).
   When it is empty, do not schedule notifications or comments.

### Expected result

The focused suite accepts the canonical JSON and its supported queue shapes.
Human guidance links to that file without duplicating machine behavior.

### Negative control

Every leaf mutation in the structured contract fails, including a missing
artifact role/path/hash/emulator/determinism/synchronization/inspection field,
instrumented artifacts, permissive activation, wrong identifiers or targets,
disabled holds, incomplete historical cleanup, empty-queue notifications, and
invalid independently discovered issue/PR relationships. Removing this case's
own required subsection also fails even when another case retains that heading.

### Interactions and save compatibility

The protocol depends on GitHub issues, pull requests, relationships, labels,
assignments, and comments when a real hold is active. Live queue contents
remain release-time evidence rather than tracked state. Cleanup history includes
every labeled PR after closure or supersession; independent ownership may retain
an assignee but never the handoff label. It changes no save, generated data,
localization, ROM/RAM, debug/release, or archival behavior.

### Automation

`python3 -m unittest scripts.docs_check_tests.test_development_workflow_skill -v`
parses the JSON contract and exercises its schema, every semantic leaf,
supported queue shapes, and fail-closed controls.

### Cleanup and limitations

This source-only case changes no remote item and cannot make the subjective
judgment itself. Live queue state and evidence remain in the relevant PR and
issue rather than this repository.
