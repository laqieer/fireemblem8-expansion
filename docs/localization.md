# In-game localization framework (issue #18)

Status: English/pseudo, Japanese (`ja`), Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`),
French (`fr`), German (`de`), Spanish (`es`), and Italian (`it`) are
production-configurable. The default remains English-only and 16 MiB; every
real localized-game profile is an explicit 32 MiB build. Expansion and
full-game catalogs, localized fonts, UTF-8 rendering, locale preference
persistence, cache switching, and localized static graphics share the same
validated profile. The final compressed catalog contains all 3,414 FE8U
messages for every production locale with zero fallback or unresolved rows.
CJK provenance remains bound to the pinned FE8J/FE8CN sources; European text,
glyph, chapter-title, prologue, AP, and UI resources are bound to authorized
FE8EU ROM SHA-256
`80f94bf10da412e6d8d1ba11c043107f4873bc17fecceb02e6a7da3d1a261d6d`.
This is an architecture/authoring/testing reference, not a remote GitHub
issue-state claim; branch-local closure evidence remains in
`reports/issue18_localization_closure.md`.

## Architecture

The framework is layered, each layer independently testable:

1. **Stable ID contract** (`scripts/localization/schema.py`,
   `include/expansion_locale.h`): an append-only `ExpansionLocaleId` list
   (`en, ja, zh-Hans, fr, de, es, it, qps-ploc`) and a 16-bit
   `ExpansionMsgId` space (`0xFFFF` reserved as "no such message"). Never
   renumbered; a retired slot's index is never reused. The Python and C
   sides are kept in sync by hand and cross-checked by
   `scripts/localization/tests/test_schema.py` plus host C driver tests.
2. **Source catalog + registry** (`texts/expansion/registry.json`,
   `texts/expansion/catalog.<locale>.json`, `scripts/localization/catalog.py`):
   the source of truth for which message IDs exist and their per-locale
   UTF-8 text. The authored mapping contains `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `fr`,
   `de`, `es`, and `it`; `qps-ploc` is derived from English. Validation rejects invalid
   Unicode scalars, control/format/private-use text, whitespace controls
   other than `\n`, malformed placeholders, placeholder/newline drift,
   surface-width overflow, UTF-8 decoded-byte overflow, and unknown pseudo
   policies. Active registry entries default to `pseudo_policy: "transform"`;
   width-critical fixed-row labels may opt into `"compact"`, while
   locale-neutral identifiers may opt into `"preserve"`.
   `scripts/localization/generate.py` compiles this into
   `expansion_locale_catalog.c` (ROM data) and `expansion_msg_ids.h`
   (generated header), write-if-unchanged. Its descriptor table is indexed
   by stable `ExpansionLocaleId`: populated locales point to their tables and
   unpopulated slots are explicit null descriptors. The budget reports actual
   authored/generated locales, populated descriptor count, missing entries,
   UTF-8 string bytes, pointer/descriptor bytes, decoded-max scratch, and
   Unicode scalar/glyph usage.
3. **Runtime resolver** (`src/expansion_locale.c`,
   `include/expansion_locale.h`): `ExpansionLocale_GetCurrent()` /
   `_SetCurrent()` / `_Resolve()` / `_InvalidateCache()`. Holds the
   current locale, a decoded-string cache (locale+msg-id keyed,
   invalidated on any locale change), and a small decode scratch buffer --
   all in `EWRAM_DATA` (see "The EWRAM-placement bug" below for why this
   matters). Resolution uses the generated descriptor indexed by stable
   locale ID, then performs at most one English lookup when the descriptor
   or requested entry is absent. Never reads/writes vanilla `GetLang()`/`SetLang()`/
   `gLanguageMode`/`gMsgTable`; entirely independent of the vanilla
   multi-language ROM mechanism. `ExpansionLocale_InvalidateCache()` also
   invalidates the full-game localized message cache in localized profiles, so
   expansion UI and `GetStringFromIndex()` cannot disagree after a switch.
4. **User preferences** (`include/expansion_save_prefs.h`,
   versioned/checksummed `ExpansionUserPrefs`, Sprint 2): a small SRAM
   record (locale choice + validity state) with its own version/checksum,
   read via `ExpansionUserPrefs_Load()`/classified via `_Normalize()` into
   `ExpansionUserPrefsState` (`UNSET` / `VALID` / `MIGRATED` / `CORRUPT` /
   `UNKNOWN_LOCALE` / `DISABLED_LOCALE`), and written via `_Store()`.
   Deliberately excludes vanilla `struct SoundRoomSaveData` and every
   other pre-existing SRAM field -- see the "no-wipe" contract below.
5. **First-start selector + Config language row**
   (`src/expansion_language_menu.c`, `include/expansion_language_menu.h`,
   Sprint 3): `ExpansionLanguageMenu_DecideStartupAction()` is a pure,
   host-testable function mapping `(prefs state, enabled locale count)` to
   one of `SHOW_MENU` / `AUTO_SELECT` / `APPLY_ONLY`. The blocking first-start
   selector Proc script runs this decision once per boot, immediately
   after `ProcScr_GameEarlyStartUI` and before `ProcScr_OpAnim` (`#ifdef
   MODERN`-guarded call site in `src/gamecontrol.c`); with exactly one
   enabled locale it silently auto-selects and never shows a UI. The
   Config row selects all enabled locales inline when there are at most
   four. With more than four it shows the first three compact locale labels
   plus `More`; only `More` opens `ExpansionLanguageMenu_OpenSettings()`.
   Inline or submenu selection calls `ExpansionUserPrefs_Store()` and
   invalidates the resolver cache only when the locale actually changes;
   `Back` leaves everything untouched. A
   `struct ExpansionLanguageMenuProbe gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` (EWRAM,
   `include/expansion_language_menu.h`) exposes `active`/`settingsActive`/
   `promptShown`/`autoSelected`/`promptReason`/`prefsState`/
   `selectedLocale`/`currentLocale`/`enabledLocaleCount`/`cacheGeneration`/
   `startupRunCount`/`settingsOpenCount`/`settingsChangeCount` for exactly
   this kind of diagnostic read -- a plain, bounded, fixed-layout struct,
   never a raw/arbitrary pointer oracle.

   Host-native tests resolve exact CJK and European expansion strings,
   generic sparse-entry English fallback, invalid/unpopulated slots, and both
   expansion/full-game cache invalidation. Production localized profiles use
   the upper bank at 32 MiB. Captured scenarios cover CJK switching and a real
   five-language European first-start selection of French.

6. **Runtime text-stream consumers** (`include/text_utf8.h`,
   `src/text_utf8.c`, `src/msg.c`, `src/scene.c`, `src/cgtext.c`,
   `src/helpbox.c`): modern localized builds decode FE controls and UTF-8 scalars
   through one token iterator. Low controls, `[LoadFace]` plus its FID,
   extended `0x80` controls, color arguments, U+3000/legacy spacing, valid
   scalars, and invalid/truncated input have explicit token boundaries.
   Dialogue, CG/name-box, and help-box interpreters never inspect UTF-8
   continuation bytes as controls. Message substitutions use a private,
   localized `msg.c` workspace with a `0x400`-byte derived-output region and
   a disjoint `0x100`-byte insertion region; the production catalog test
   conservatively bounds every current substitution stream at 273 bytes.
   The active localized-message cache remains separate, and CG name-box
   copies use a caller-owned `0x100`-byte stack buffer. Neither path borrows
   `gBufPrep`, which is live support-screen/preparation overlay state.
   English-only and archival builds emit none of this workspace. The
   historical two-argument `GetStringFromIndexInBuffer()` ABI remains for
   legacy builds; an unknown-size call in a modern localized build returns
   `<!LOC_CAP!>` with `LEGACY_BUFFER_UNBOUNDED` instead of writing
   unboundedly. Production callers use
   `GetStringFromIndexInBufferWithLimit()`.

7. **Tactician name entry** (`src/sio_tactician.c`, `src/bmio.c`): the
   persistent `PlaySt.playerName` field remains 11 bytes, so every modern
   entry and setter path accepts at most 10 encoded bytes plus one NUL.
   Oversize input is rejected atomically; UTF-8 is never truncated inside a
   scalar. English, qps-ploc, and the archival grid retain their original
   five-character story / nine-character Link Arena behavior.

   Japanese page 1 is the supported hiragana gojuon, voiced/semi-voiced
   kana, and practical small kana; page 2 is the supported katakana
   counterpart plus the long-vowel mark.
   Every scalar occurs in the committed normalized FE8J source
   `texts/locales/ja/indexed.txt` and `fonts/cjk/maps/ja.txt`. Simplified
   Chinese pages are deterministic: ignore `#` metadata lines in
   `texts/locales/zh-Hans/indexed.txt`, count U+4E00--U+9FFF occurrences,
   sort by descending frequency then ascending scalar value, and take the
   first 150 scalars as two row-major 75-cell pages. Page 3 uses the existing
   ASCII grid. Locale pages use a 13-pixel cell pitch; selected glyph widths
   are validated against the committed production font codepoint/width data.

## Config

Set at `modern.mk`/`make` invocation time (see
`scripts/modernize/expansion_config.py` for validation):

- `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` -- comma-separated subset of the production
  allowlist `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`, `fr`, `de`, `es`, `it`, and `qps-ploc`
  (default: `en`), always
  including `en` for fallback. Input order is normalized to stable locale-ID
  order.
- `EXPANSION_DEFAULT_LOCALE` -- must be a member of
  `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` (default: `en`).
- `EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE` -- `1` enables `qps-ploc`, and requires
  `qps-ploc` to actually be present in `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES` (the two
  can never silently disagree -- `validate_pseudo_locale` rejects that
  combination outright).
- `MODERN_ROM_SIZE` -- remains `16M` by default. Enabling any real localized
  game locale requires exactly `32M`; English-only and English+pseudo remain
  valid at either size.

Profile examples:

```bash
# Supported default: unchanged English-only 16 MiB ROM.
make expansion-modern-rom

# Existing pseudo-locale test profile, still 16 MiB.
make expansion-modern-rom \
  EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES=en,qps-ploc \
  EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE=1

# Named 32 MiB production profiles (MODERN_CONFIG=debug or release).
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-ja
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-zh-hans
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-ja-zh-hans
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-fr-de-es-it
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-all

# Optional four-locale profile; Config shows EN, JA, ZH, QPS.
make expansion-modern-localization-profile-en-ja-zh-hans-qps
```

Equivalent direct builds may set `EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES`,
`EXPANSION_DEFAULT_LOCALE`, and `MODERN_ROM_SIZE=32M` explicitly. A real
localized profile with `MODERN_ROM_SIZE=16M` fails before compilation. The named targets
use private build roots so their generated catalogs, fonts, metadata, and
objects cannot cross-contaminate one another.

`make expansion-modern-localization-profile-headroom-check
MODERN_CONFIG={debug,release}` builds those four roots serially, validates each
real map against its ELF by output-section name, VMA, and size (including
populated `.locale_data`), and requires positive EWRAM headroom plus the
linker's IWRAM user-stack margin. The CJK runtime gate runs this matrix before
its trilingual libmGBA scenarios. The 0x1600 decoded-message cache remains in
EWRAM; the separate 0x500 private transformation workspace is transient and
linked after the fixed IWRAM layout. `crt0` initializes the downward-growing
system/user stack at `__sp_usr`; the historical fixed layout left 0x1658 bytes
below it and the CJK workspace leaves 0x1158, so the linker and budget gate
preserve a 0x1000 minimum while retaining 0x158 bytes of static-growth
headroom. No generated maximum or transform capacity is reduced.

These are baked into the ROM's embedded `ExpansionMetadata` (build-commit,
enabled-locale mask, default-locale id, pseudo-locale flag) so a given ROM's
config is always recoverable from the binary itself, never only from the
build invocation.


`modern.mk` derives `FE8_EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALE_MASK`,
`FE8_EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALE_COUNT`, `FE8_EXPANSION_DEFAULT_LOCALE_ID`, and
`FE8_EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE_ENABLED` from these validated inputs. The
normalized enabled list/default/pseudo setting also enters the config
fingerprint, so configuration changes are diagnosable without becoming save-
compatibility keys.

## Save compatibility, migration, and precedence

Issue #18 uses `SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION_CURRENT=2` and the repository default
`EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH=2`. `ExpansionUserPrefs` occupies a fixed
0x0C-byte subregion of `ExpansionSaveMeta.reserved`, has independent magic,
version and checksum, and leaves 0x20 bytes of reserved-tail headroom. The
outer metadata layout and neighboring XMAP offset do not move.

Classifier precedence matters: an older `formatVersion` resolves to
`SAVE_COMPAT_MIGRATABLE_OLDER` before the epoch comparison, so a genuine
version-1/epoch-1 save is migratable older, not config-incompatible. The host
`save_format_tool.py migrate` path is out-of-place, preserves an older/current
record's reserved bytes (including valid prefs), verifies before atomic
publication, and never rewrites the source. Runtime normalization falls back
to the configured default and requests repair for unset/corrupt/unknown/
disabled prefs; only a verified bounded store mutates the prefs window. The
full record, migration, no-wipe, and menu limitations are authoritative in
[`save_format.md`](save_format.md).

## Pseudo locale (`qps-ploc`) contract

`qps-ploc` (`scripts/localization/pseudo.py`) is a deterministic, purely
mechanical transform of the English catalog (accenting/padding/bracketing
ASCII test markers), generated at build time from `catalog.en.json` --
**never a translation, never hand-authored foreign text, and never
represents any real language**. The default policy for every active registry
entry is `pseudo_policy: "transform"`. An active locale-neutral identifier may
instead declare `"pseudo_policy": "preserve"`; the generated qps entry then
uses the exact English bytes while all other entries keep the normal transform.
An active fixed-row label may declare `"pseudo_policy": "compact"` to keep the
alternating-case pseudo signal without brackets or vowel expansion; its actual
runtime geometry must still be validated.
The build timestamp diagnostic uses this policy so `en`, `ja`, `zh-Hans`,
`qps-ploc`, and `gBuildDateTime` remain byte-identical. Unknown policies and
policy fields on tombstones are schema errors. Every user-facing surface that
can display it (the selector list and the More submenu) labels it
`"Pseudo (Test)"`;
the compact Config-row label is the cataloged code `QPS`. Locale proper
names/codes remain resolved against `EXPANSION_LOCALE_EN`
(`Japanese`/`Simplified Chinese`, `JA`/`ZH`) so every first-start row is
readable before a locale is chosen. Most Japanese/Chinese expansion-catalog
text is original expansion-framework UI/debug text.
The two `raw_surface.unit_action.*` keys are the deliberate exception: they are
semantic modern adapters for two regional game commands that share one FE8U
message ID. Their Japanese/Chinese strings retain authorized raw-source
provenance documented in `docs/game_locale_sources.md`; the raw address/import
ID never becomes the runtime key.
All current-locale labels/help/back/debug
strings, including Japanese and Chinese text, render through UTF-8-aware
`Text_DrawString`; no expansion-resolved framework surface uses
`Text_DrawStringASCII`. All six real locales are production-configurable for
explicit 32 MiB builds as described above.

## Authoring

1. Add/edit entries in `texts/expansion/registry.json` (append-only IDs,
   never renumbering or reusing a retired id) and each authored
   `texts/expansion/catalog.<locale>.json`. English is the required fallback.
   Omit `pseudo_policy` for the default qps transform; use
   `"pseudo_policy": "compact"` only for fixed-row labels whose generated qps
   width is checked against the real allocation, and use `"preserve"` only for
   active locale-neutral identifiers whose qps bytes must remain exactly equal
   to English.
   The committed real-locale catalogs intentionally cover every active
   key. The resolver retains a defensive missing-entry fallback for malformed
   or future sparse profiles, but production JA/ZH reports exercise none.
   Raw-only game surfaces must use a semantic `raw_surface.*` key, not a ROM
   address or `fe8cn.raw.import-*` identifier, and must be recorded in the raw
   closure ledger.
2. `make localization-generate` (or let any modern build target
   depend on it) regenerates `expansion_locale_catalog.c`/
   `expansion_msg_ids.h`/the localization budget JSON, write-if-unchanged.
   Full-game authored translations use the separate normalized shard platform
   at `texts/locales/authored/`. Its manifest pins the historical 259-row
   source queue and every shard hash; the merger produces canonical 329-key
   JA/ZH runtime catalogs (259 fulfilled queue rows plus 70 existing
   expansion-backed or target-specific semantic corrections):

   ```bash
   python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales build-authored-catalogs
   python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales check-authored-catalogs
   python3 -m scripts.localization.game_locales check-final-mapping \
     --require-no-fallback --require-live-origin
   ```

   The production compressed catalog is 3,414/3,414 present for every real
   locale, with zero English fallback and zero unresolved rows. European rows
   use the authoritative `fe8eu_to_fe8u.json` ledger, official indexed text,
   reviewed target-specific translations, and explicit split-message
   concatenation where FE8EU and FE8U regional message boundaries differ. The
   independent 143-record raw-surface closure also has zero fallback,
   exclusion, and unresolved record. Its Japanese raw-symbol providers are
   fail-closed against vendored commit/tree/blob objects for the pinned FE8J
   source commit. Only real C initializers, assembly label/data bodies, or
   exact authorized-ROM slices whose offsets come from the committed FE8J
   baseline map are accepted; comments, extern-only declarations, and nested
   generated manifests are not data. The goal-slice manifest pins the FE8J
   ROM SHA-256, map blob, ROM offsets, lengths, byte hashes, decoded values,
   and the minimal 23-byte CP932 artifact. A separate committed SHA-256 range
   proof binds those slices to an independently locked known-ROM Merkle root;
   offline checks consume but cannot refresh it. Maintainers must run the
   mandatory local maintainer pre-push verification documented in
   [`game_locale_sources.md`](game_locale_sources.md). That procedure
   serially checks authored catalogs, no-fallback/live-origin final mapping,
   raw-surface closure, runtime leakage, and committed CJK fonts, and reports
   the verified ROM SHA-256 and exact slices.
   `refresh-ja-raw-origin` requires the live pinned FE8J ROM. Per-provider
   source paths, symbols, slots, and
   CP932 bytes are exact, and
   symbol-backed decisions cannot omit
   `provider_anchor`. See `docs/game_locale_sources.md` for the offline and
   mandatory raw-closure gate. The shared modern English bundle remains the
   real `en` locale; zero CJK fallback does not remove or duplicate it.
   `build-final-mapping` also regenerates
   `texts/locales/mapping/ending_layout_metrics.json`. That gate reads the
   real `InitText` allocations in `src/ending_details.c` (120 pixels for all
   33 character titles and up to five 208-pixel lines for all 33 solo and 34
   paired endings) and measures every JA/ZH line with the committed runtime
   system-font widths. A missing glyph, physical newline, invalid line count,
   or overflow fails generation.
   It also regenerates
   `texts/locales/mapping/fixed_width_label_metrics.json`. That manifest
   enumerates every final JA/ZH character, class, and item name from
   `gCharacterData`, `gClassData`, and `gItemData`; pins the real 40/64/56
   pixel UI call sites and font metrics; and requires a surface-specific
   compact alias for every canonical overflow. Only those three audited
   `...DisplayNameForWidth(..., maxPixels)` calls can select aliases, and each
   first returns the canonical name when it fits the actual width. Every call
   is guarded by `FE8_LOCALIZED_GAME_TEXT_CJK_PROFILE_ENABLED`; non-CJK modern
   and legacy preprocessing retains the original expressions. The canonical
   catalog names remain unchanged.
   The final full-game catalog validator independently checks every present
   JA/ZH payload rather than a target allowlist. Every `ToggleMouthMove` must
   be paired before a dialogue boundary; FE8U-domain payloads whose dialogue
   boundary topology matches the FE8U target must also match its mouth-toggle
   topology. Every rendered line in all face-bearing talk payloads is measured
   with the committed runtime talk-font widths and must fit the 240-pixel
   talk allocation. Controls, page boundaries, and face-segment boundaries do
   not contribute visible width and reset the measured line as the runtime
   does.
4. `texts/locales/mapping/text_width_contexts.json` is the typed, canonical
   mapping from all 3,414 message IDs to the narrowest source-visible
   scene/usage context. Event dialogue is discovered from `TEXTSHOW`,
   `WM_TEXT`, and `EvtTextShow2`; ending details and fixed labels retain their
   stricter existing metric validators; all remaining messages use the
   documented 30-tile system-`Text` default. No entry is silently exempted.
   `python3 -m scripts.localization.game_catalog check-width` resolves the
   final payloads, measures every visible line with the **matching runtime
   system or talk VWF advances**, and fails on a missing glyph, unbreakable
   span, or overrun. It is part of `make game-localization-test` and
   `game-localization-check`.

### Deterministic CJK line breaking and runtime guard

Catalog generation applies the same width contract before compression. It
preserves authored `[CTRL:0001]`, page, portrait, and all other controls
byte-for-byte, then inserts only the existing one-byte `[NL]` control at a
safe scalar boundary when required. Latin words are never split; CJK breaks
are allowed between ideographs but never after opening or before closing
kinsoku punctuation. A scalar or word with no legal boundary is an explicit
generation failure, never truncation or replacement. The generated catalog
report records every target's context, measured maximum, and inserted-break
count; the source catalogs remain authored source, not rewritten inputs.

`EXPANSION_LOCALIZED_TEXT_AUTO_WRAP=0` is the default, preserving historical
runtime behavior. Setting it to `1` for a modern CJK build (for example
`make ... EXPANSION_ENABLED_LOCALES=en,ja MODERN_ROM_SIZE=32M
EXPANSION_LOCALIZED_TEXT_AUTO_WRAP=1`) enables a second, allocation-aware
guard in `TalkInterpret`: it uses actual VWF advances and the active
`Text::tile_width`, advances to the next line before a dynamic substitution
would overrun, and never edits the stream. Generated explicit breaks remain
authoritative, so the guard does not double-wrap them. The flag is validated
as 0/1 and included in the modern build fingerprint.

`SubtitleHelp` is an explicit nonstandard consumer: `bb.c` visually splits
its scrolling talk-font stream itself, but treats byte `0x01` as a terminator.
The width registry therefore classifies the convoy subtitle targets separately:
their width is audited by that renderer, and catalog generation must never
insert an `[NL]` control into them.

The generated [original text edit ledger](game_locale_text_edits.md) separately
records every indexed JA/ZH source edit and its reviewed provenance. It is
checked by `make game-localization-text-edits-check`; the catalog's new
expansion-only keys are explicitly outside that original-game comparison.
3. `python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/localization/tests -p
   'test_*.py' -v` (or `make localization-test`) re-validates schema,
   strict UTF-8/control, surface-width and UTF-8 byte budgets, placeholder/
   newline parity, pseudo transform, descriptor generation, host-native
   exact/fallback/cache behavior, and vanilla-isolation audits.
4. CJK builds must use `MODERN_ROM_SIZE=32M`; English/qps-only builds may
   remain 16 MiB. Other real locale IDs must first gain populated catalogs,
   fonts, game-text providers, and configuration validation. Translation
   sources must follow `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the pinned-provenance workflow;
   do not hand-copy or paraphrase unapproved third-party text.

### Efficient local and pre-merge validation

Use targeted localization tests while editing. After pushing the exact
candidate branch, run the broad host/CJK/runtime/release evidence once in the
dispatch-only full matrix:

```bash
gh workflow run full-matrix.yml --ref <branch>
gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status
```

The host lane rebuilds the committed locale-source, crosswalk, and raw-closure
artifacts offline and never receives legally restricted FE8J inputs. That is
not a substitute for the mandatory live FE8J provenance proof, which remains
a local maintainer pre-push step rather than a CI command. Follow
[`game_locale_sources.md`](game_locale_sources.md) for the procedure supported
by the checked-out branch; do not copy a target from another branch or upload
restricted inputs to GitHub Actions. The workflow summary records the exact
`github.sha`/`github.ref`; its modern debug/release matrix already owns the
subordinate CJK profiles, runtime, shifted-link, and linker-budget gates.

## Testing -- real libmGBA runtime evidence (Sprint 4)

The byte-consumer closure adds three focused host gates:

```sh
python3 scripts/texttools/tests/test_text_renderer_native.py
python3 scripts/texttools/tests/test_text_consumers_native.py
python3 scripts/texttools/tests/test_text_consumer_audit.py
```

They execute the real `msg.c` bounded substitutions and the real
scene/CG/help measurement/name-copy functions on the host, including a UTF-8
continuation byte equal to `0x80`, `[Tact]`/`[Item]`/FID/`[SetName]`,
U+3000, pauses/newlines, exact-capacity output, guard bytes, malformed and
truncated tokens, English/qps behavior, and the no-unknown-size-caller audit.
The production CJK debug scenarios remain
`expansion-modern-localization-runtime-cjk-check`; they prove the linked
32 MiB ROM boots and switches/persists Japanese and Chinese. No committed
scenario currently navigates far enough into a chapter to reach a dialogue,
help box, and CG name box in one deterministic replay, so those three
consumer paths are covered by host-native execution plus debug/release ARM
compile/link rather than a new synthetic fingerprint.

Sprint 4 adds `tools/gba-playtest` scenario/fingerprint pairs that boot the
**actual compiled ROM** under libmGBA and assert real, reached runtime
states via `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` + SRAM-hash + framebuffer-hash
checkpoints -- not host-only input replay. All scenarios reach the real
selector using the same boot-timing recipe as the existing `boot.json`
family: skip the vanilla title/intro sequence with an explicit
`SKIP_HS`-style key-hold window, since a longer generic intro-mash sequence
can accidentally auto-dismiss the selector before its checkpoint frame.

Scenarios (`tools/gba-playtest/scenarios/locale-*.json`,
fingerprints in the matching `tools/gba-playtest/fingerprints/` file):

| Scenario | Proves |
|---|---|
| `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-default-modern-{debug,release}` | Blank SRAM, single enabled locale (`en`): selector auto-selects silently, reachable before intro/title. |
| `locale-blank-sram-selector-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | Blank SRAM, multi-locale build (`en,qps-ploc`): issue #18 sprint 6 fixed `BuildCurrentExpansionSaveMeta()` unconditionally auto-stamping a syntactically VALID prefs record on a blank-SRAM boot regardless of enabled-locale count; the selector now genuinely shows (`active=1`, `needsPreferenceRepair=1`) and stays shown pre-title, matching a real `UNSET` fixture's own behavior. Supersedes the pre-fix `locale-blank-sram-no-selector-multi-modern-{debug,release}` pair, which had encoded the bug itself as "expected" and has been deleted. |
| `locale-auto-select-single-locale-modern-{debug,release}` | An `UNSET` prefs sub-state (real reachable fixture, not blank SRAM) with one enabled locale: `AUTO_SELECT`, `promptShown=0`, never a visible selector -- contract item "one enabled en auto-select no visible selector". |
| `locale-selector-multi-switch-qps-modern-debug` | Real selector navigation choosing `qps-ploc`; persisted via `ExpansionUserPrefs_Store` (`cacheGeneration` bump visible in probe). |
| `locale-prefs-corrupt-no-wipe-modern-debug` | Corrupt `ExpansionUserPrefs` -> re-prompt; full-SRAM hash (minus three justified exclusions below) is unchanged frame-5 to frame-600: no wipe. |
| `locale-prefs-unknown-locale-no-wipe-modern-debug` | Same, for an unknown-locale-id prefs record. |
| `locale-prefs-disabled-locale-no-wipe-modern-debug` | Same, for a prefs record naming a locale not compiled into this build. |
| `locale-repair-{unset,corrupt,unknown,disabled}-multi-modern-{debug,release}` | Issue #18 sprint 7: the real 4x2 repair matrix. Unlike the three `-no-wipe-modern-debug` rows above (single-locale build, debug-only, repair collapses to silent `AUTO_SELECT`), these 8 scenarios boot the same `en,qps-ploc` multi-locale ROM as the rest of this table, in **both** debug and release, so the real blocking selector (`active=1`, `autoSelected=0`, `needsPreferenceRepair=1`, per-state `promptReason`/`prefsState`) is what actually gets exercised and repaired. Each scenario: hashes the whole SRAM image at boot; shows the prompt; explicitly navigates down to `qps-ploc` and back up to `en` (proving a real cursor round-trip, not a scripted single keypress) before confirming the *default* English row -- the sprint-6 `mustRepair` fix (`src/expansion_language_menu.c`) is what makes `ExpansionUserPrefs_Store()` fire even though the chosen locale equals the runtime own current fallback; re-hashes the whole SRAM image (minus the same three exclusions as the no-wipe rows) to prove no-wipe across the repair; then sends a real `A+B+SELECT+START` soft reset and, on the resulting genuine second boot, proves the persisted record now classifies `VALID` and the selector/prompt stay suppressed. Superseding claim: the pre-existing `-no-wipe-modern-debug` scenarios remain honestly named (they still real-capture their own single-locale/debug/no-wipe claim) but are not, and never were, a substitute for this matrix. |
| `locale-settings-inline-single-modern-release` | Real release navigation to the single-locale Language row; Right is a no-op and never opens a redundant submenu (`settingsActive`/`settingsOpenCount` stay zero). |
| `locale-settings-real-navigation-multi-modern-debug` | Real Prep Map -> Options -> Configuration navigation in the two-locale build. RIGHT/LEFT/RIGHT selects `QPS`/`EN`/`QPS` inline, persists every change, and proves `settingsActive`/`settingsOpenCount` stay zero. |
| `locale-softreset-persistence-multi-modern-debug` | Real first-run selector chooses `qps-ploc`, then a genuine A+B+SELECT+START soft-reset key combo (held ~20-24 frames through libmGBA's own HLE BIOS -- a real hardware reboot, not a fixture swap) reboots the ROM; continuous, never-swapped SRAM: selector is skipped post-reset (`promptShown`/`active` stay 0) and `currentLocale` is `qps-ploc` again without re-selection. |
| `locale-cjk-first-start-{ja,zh-hans}-modern-debug` | Captured three-locale `en,ja,zh-Hans` first-start selector evidence with bounded probes for choosing locale id 1 or 2. |
| `locale-cjk-settings-inline-modern-debug` | Captured real Config navigation for inline EN -> JA -> ZH switching; `settingsOpenCount` stays zero because three locales fit inline. |
| `locale-cjk-softreset-persistence-modern-debug` | Captured Simplified Chinese first-start choice plus real soft-reset persistence. |

Every save/load and suspend/resume regression coverage for locale prefs
reuses the existing, unmodified `expansion-modern-saveload-check`/
`expansion-modern-savefmt-check` gates (see the `-runtime-save-check`
Make target below) rather than duplicating that harness.

Run the captured production CJK matrix with:

```bash
make expansion-modern-localization-runtime-cjk-check MODERN_CONFIG=debug
```

### The "no-wipe" SRAM-hash exclusions

The three prefs-safety scenarios' `sram_hash_exclude_ranges` are exactly:

- `{"offset": "0x7224", "length": "0x24"}` -- vanilla
  `struct SoundRoomSaveData soundRoomSave` (`include/bmsave.h`), which
  legitimately rewrites 2 of its own bytes on every boot as ordinary
  pre-existing sound-room bookkeeping, **unrelated to locale/expansion
  code or prefs state** (confirmed identical across all three fixtures via
  a full 0x8000-byte SRAM diff, chunked at the backend's 1024-probe/
  checkpoint cap).
- `{"offset": "0x73A0", "length": "0x04"}` -- the vanilla `SramInit()`
  hardware self-test scratch pad (`gSram->reserved`, `include/bmsave.h`),
  which the console's own boot-time SRAM self-test legitimately rewrites
  on every boot, **unrelated to locale/expansion code or prefs state**.
- `{"offset": "0x73D4", "length": "0x0C"}` -- the `ExpansionUserPrefs`
  record itself, which is *expected* to be rewritten (its own checksum/
  version bookkeeping) even when the effective locale choice is unchanged
  by a rejected corrupt/unknown/disabled value.

Each of these three excluded regions is additionally probed byte-by-byte
(GBA SRAM is 8-bit-wide hardware -- multi-byte reads alias a single byte
across all lanes, so every probe here uses `size: 1`) at both the pre-
runtime-init baseline and the post-decision-settled checkpoint, alongside
`ExpansionSaveMeta`'s own magic/checksum and the untouched XMAP save
header's magic/checksum/`save_magic32` -- proving these regions are
stable/known rather than silently masked by the exclusion, without hand-
writing any of their expected values (only the two genuinely vanilla,
locale-independent fields above -- the SoundRoom struct and the SRAM
self-test pad -- have inline `expected` values at all; `ExpansionSaveMeta`/
XMAP checksums are commit-dependent and therefore captured, never
hand-typed).

No other byte anywhere in the 0x8000-byte SRAM image differs between the
pre- and post-boot checkpoints for any of the three fixtures -- this is
the real, capture-verified evidence for the "corrupt/unknown/disabled
prefs never wipe SRAM" contract item, not an assumption.

### The real multi-locale repair matrix (issue #18 sprint 7)

The three `-no-wipe-modern-debug` scenarios above are real, but they only
ever run the single-locale (default `en`-only) build: with exactly one
enabled locale, `ExpansionLanguageMenu_RuntimeInit()`'s own selector logic
has nothing to prompt over, so a corrupt/unknown/disabled prefs record is
"repaired" by silent `AUTO_SELECT` -- the blocking selector itself is
never actually shown or driven. That leaves the contract's real
multi-locale prompt/choose-default repair path (and its release-build
counterpart) unproven. `tools/gba-playtest/scenarios/locale-repair-
{unset,corrupt,unknown,disabled}-multi-modern-{debug,release}.json` (8
files, all real-captured, `fingerprints/` matched, `--policy behavior`
verified) close that gap:

- **Same `en,qps-ploc` ROM as the rest of this table**, in both `debug`
  and `release` -- the release half is mandatory, never skipped.
- **Baseline**: whole-SRAM hash (minus the same three "no-wipe" exclusion
  ranges documented above -- `0x7224`/`0x24`, `0x73A0`/`0x04`,
  `0x73D4`/`0x0C`) taken before `RuntimeInit()` even runs, from the
  state-specific fixture (`unset.sav`/`corrupt.sav`/`unknown.sav`/
  `disabled_on_multi.sav` -- the last one is new this sprint, built with
  `--disabled-locale-id 1` since `qps-ploc`'s own id, 7, is *enabled* on
  this multi-locale build and therefore can no longer name a disabled
  locale here).
- **Prompt checkpoint**: `active=1`, `autoSelected=0` (never
  `AUTO_SELECT` -- this is the exact silent-repair collapse this sprint
  closes), `needsPreferenceRepair=1`, and a `promptReason`/`prefsState`
  pair matching the fixture's own real classification (`UNSET`/`CORRUPT`/
  `UNKNOWN_LOCALE`/`DISABLED_LOCALE`).
- **Real cursor round-trip**: navigates `DOWN` to `qps-ploc` (framebuffer-
  hashed) then back `UP` to `en` (framebuffer hash byte-identical to the
  original prompt checkpoint's -- proof this is a real second keypress
  landing back on the same row, not a scripted single confirm) before
  pressing `A`.
- **Explicit default-choice repair**: confirming `en` here is the
  runtime's own current fallback locale, so this exercises the sprint-6
  `mustRepair = active && needsPreferenceRepair` fix in
  `ExpansionLanguageMenu_RowSelected()` (`src/expansion_language_menu.c`)
  -- without it, choosing the row that already equals the fallback would
  short-circuit and never call `ExpansionUserPrefs_Store()`.
- **Commit checkpoint**: `active=0`, `needsPreferenceRepair=0`,
  `cacheGeneration=1` (proving `Store()` fired), the persisted record
  reads `magic=0xA5`/`version=0x01`/`localeId=0x00`(`en`)/`flags=0x01`
  (`EXPLICIT`), and the whole-SRAM hash (same three exclusions) is
  byte-identical to the baseline hash -- no wipe across the repair.
- **Real soft reset, not a fixture swap**: the literal `A+B+SELECT+START`
  combo is held on the same, never-replaced SRAM image, exactly like
  `locale-softreset-persistence-multi-modern-debug` above.
- **Post-reset checkpoints**: a fresh-EWRAM checkpoint immediately after
  reboot, then a settled checkpoint proving `active=0`, `promptShown=0`
  (selector/prompt genuinely absent, not merely unchecked) and
  `prefsState=0x05` (`VALID`) -- only a genuine second boot's own
  `Load()`+`Normalize()` can produce this classification, since the probe
  field is set once per boot and never refreshed mid-boot after
  `Store()`.

`scripts/modernize/tests/test_modern_localization_header_bootstrap.py`'s
`ModernLocalizationRepairMatrixTests` enumerates this exact 4x2 matrix as
a static host test (file/fingerprint existence, required checkpoint
names, the `A+B+SELECT+START` input, the `autoSelected=0`/prompt-reason/
prefs-state/no-wipe/VALID-after-reboot invariants above, the fixture
mapping, and that `modern.mk` wires all 8 pairs into
`expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check` unconditionally,
never inside the `ifeq ($(MODERN_CONFIG),debug)` guard) -- it fails if a
release pair goes missing or a scenario silently regresses to
`AUTO_SELECT`.

### Real inline settings navigation and soft-reset persistence

`locale-settings-real-navigation-multi-modern-debug` drives the actual,
reachable in-game UI path a player uses -- Prep Map -> `Options` ->
Configuration -> `Language` -- entirely through replayed controller input.
In the two-locale build the row displays compact `EN` and `QPS` choices:
RIGHT/LEFT/RIGHT selects QPS/English/QPS without opening a submenu.
`currentLocale`, `cacheGeneration`, `settingsChangeCount`, and the persisted
prefs bytes move with each real selection, while `settingsActive` and
`settingsOpenCount` remain zero. The release-only
`locale-settings-inline-single-modern-release` route proves Right is a no-op
when English is the sole enabled locale.

`locale-softreset-persistence-multi-modern-debug` proves persistence
across an actual reboot, not a fixture swap: it replays the real
first-run-selector input choosing `qps-ploc` (same proven sequence as
`locale-selector-multi-switch-qps`), then holds the real GBA hardware
soft-reset combo (`A+B+SELECT+START`) for ~20-24 frames. libmGBA's
default HLE BIOS implements this combo without any custom backend/game
code -- holding it triggers a genuine full reboot (fresh EWRAM/BSS,
`startupRunCount` resets to 0), while the underlying SRAM image is never
swapped or replaced. Post-reboot, the selector does not reappear
(`promptShown`/`active` stay 0) and `currentLocale` reads back `qps-ploc`
without any re-selection -- real persistence across a real reboot on
continuous SRAM.

The inline scenario's framebuffer checkpoints visibly distinguish the blue
selected `EN`/`QPS` value while its EWRAM/SRAM probes establish the semantic
selection and persistence contract independently of pixels.

### Probe schema/bounds host tests

`tools/gba-playtest/tests/test_locale_probe_schema.py` compiles and runs a
small driver (`tools/gba-playtest/tests/c/
expansion_language_menu_probe_offsets_driver.c`) against the real,
unmodified `include/expansion_language_menu.h` to get the compiler's own
`offsetof()`/`sizeof()` for every `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` field, then
cross-checks every locale scenario and fingerprint's symbolic
`gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe+0xNN` expression against
`offsetof(field)` and every probe's size against the struct's real
bounds/field width. Literal EWRAM addresses are a failing negative control.

`tools/gba-playtest/gba_playtest.py --elf <exact-linked.elf>` resolves those
expressions through the shared `probe_bindings.py` ELF-symbol facility before
building the backend read plan. Capture and fingerprint validation preserve the
authored expression, so behavior comparison is independent of the symbol's
linked address. Every localization runtime target passes the ELF paired with
its exact default, multi-locale, CJK, European, or shifted ROM and the Make
toolchain's configured `MODERN_NM`. A future EWRAM layout shift therefore
changes the runtime binding, not the committed semantic scenario or
fingerprint.

### XMAP / region-magic

`scripts/shiftcheck/scan_build_addrs.py` and the existing shifted-link
gate (`expansion-modern-shifted-check`) are unchanged by this sprint;
`expansion-modern-localization-runtime-shifted-check` (below) additionally
proves the locale resolver/selector-probe scenarios still pass under a
`__text_shift=0x40000` relink, resolving probes from `shifted.elf` itself,
i.e. no hardcoded/build-address-dependent behavior was introduced by this
feature.

### Make targets

- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-debug-check` /
  `-release-check`: blank-SRAM-selector + auto-select scenarios, per
  config.
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-multi-check`: builds an
  independent `en,qps-ploc` ROM (own build root, `EXPANSION_ENABLED_
  LOCALES`/`EXPANSION_PSEUDO_LOCALE` overrides -- a real, separate ROM
  build/fingerprint set, never conflated with the single-locale metadata/
  budget numbers) and verifies the multi-locale blank-SRAM + selector-
  switch-to-qps scenarios *and* -- unconditionally, for both
  `MODERN_CONFIG=debug` and `=release`, never inside the debug-only
  `ifeq` guard that scopes the other per-config-only scenarios below --
  all 8 `locale-repair-{unset,corrupt,unknown,disabled}-multi-modern-
  {debug,release}` real repair-matrix scenarios (issue #18 sprint 7; see
  "The real multi-locale repair matrix" above). The 4 new fixture
  prerequisites (`unset.sav`/`corrupt.sav`/`unknown.sav`/
  `disabled_on_multi.sav`) are declared alongside the pre-existing
  fixtures in this same file.
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-prefs-check`: the three,
  honestly-named, single-locale/debug-only corrupt/unknown/disabled-locale
  no-wipe scenarios. These still real-capture their own single-locale
  no-wipe claim and remain in the gate on their own merits, but they are
  **not**, and never were, a substitute for the multi-locale repair
  matrix wired into `-multi-check` above (single enabled locale means
  their repair collapses to silent `AUTO_SELECT`, never the real
  blocking selector).
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-save-check`: depends on the
  existing `expansion-modern-saveload-check` + `expansion-modern-
  savefmt-check` (regression coverage only, no new save-format scenarios).
- `expansion-modern-localization-runtime-shifted-check`: reruns the
  blank-SRAM + auto-select scenarios through `scripts/shiftcheck/
  modern_shifted_boot.sh` under a `__text_shift=0x40000` relink.

All six are wired into `expansion-modern-linker-check`'s dependency list
(both `MODERN_CONFIG=debug` and `=release` pass end-to-end, run
sequentially -- `-j` parallel runs of the full gate have shown spurious,
non-reproducible failures in a complex multi-target graph with several
sub-`$(MAKE)` invocations; always verify the full gate sequentially).

## Budgets

`make expansion-modern-localization-budget`/`-budget-check`
(`scripts/linker_report/localization_budget.py`,
`reports/linker-budget/modern-localization-{debug,release}.json`) reports:

- `rom_catalog_index` / `rom_catalog_strings`: real `nm -S` sizes for the
  generated catalog/index ROM symbols.
- `ewram_ui_state` / `ewram_resolver_state`: real `nm -S` sizes for
  `gExpansionLanguageMenuProbe` and the resolver's EWRAM cache/scratch
  symbols.
- `source_catalog_budget`: the source-side string/index/decoded-max/
  populated-descriptor, UTF-8 byte, Unicode-scalar, and glyph-usage numbers
  from `scripts/localization/generate.py`.
- `regions_headroom`: per-region (`rom`/`ewram`/`iwram`) `capacity_bytes`/
  `occupied_bytes`/`free_bytes`/`overflow`, computed from the **real**
  linker `.map` for this exact build -- including the floating `.data`/
  `.bss` tail up to `__floating_end` and whatever pinned symbol follows
  it. `--check` only fails on a real `overflow: true` reported by the map
  itself; there is no fixed byte threshold anywhere in this tool (in
  particular, no hardcoded "2820"/"3508" pass criterion from earlier
  research notes -- those numbers were never load-bearing here).
- `locale_bank` (when the current linker map exposes `.locale_data` and/or
  `__locale_bank_start`/`__locale_bank_end`): actual upper-bank start/end,
  occupancy, and headroom to `0x0A000000`. Older reports/maps without those
  symbols remain readable and simply omit this optional field.

The generic map/ELF comparison treats only non-empty mapped sections as
allocatable expectations. GNU ld emits an empty 16 MiB `.locale_data` output
placeholder without `SHF_ALLOC`, while every populated CJK bank is non-empty
and allocatable; therefore empty default builds compare cleanly and a genuine
populated-bank omission still fails.

## Localized static UI graphics

`graphics/localized_ui/` contains decompressed, typed sources for CJK title,
menu, prologue, and chapter graphics plus the FE8EU European resource set.
`scripts/localization/eu.py` extracts 46 language-sensitive compressed
resource groups, raw EXP-bar graphics, three AP definitions, seven prologue
slides, and all 88 chapter-title slots per European locale. Central remapping
in `Decompress`, `RegisterDataMove`, `APProc_Create`, and the battle-effect
graphics loaders preserves existing consumers while selecting resources from
`src/data/localized_eu_ui_graphics.c`.

`graphics/localized_ui/manifest.json` pins source ROM hashes, addresses,
indexed-PNG and raw-tile round-trip hashes/dimensions, title-table records,
and the shared CJK title-sprite layout. Check committed artifacts without
reference ROMs:

```bash
make localized-ui-graphics-check
make eu-localization-check
```

The Save Menu's main-sprite sheet and OBJ OAM composition are one locale-bound
resource. `GetSaveMenuMainOptionSprite()` resolves an explicit FE8J or FE8CN
layout through `ExpansionLocale_GetCurrent()`; English and European locales
retain the original FE8U layout. The descriptor registry is active whenever
either CJK locale is enabled and does not alter locale preferences, saves, or
configuration identity.

`TC-ISSUE18-ZH-HANS-MAIN-MENU-OAM-001` is captured by
`locale-cjk-softreset-persistence-modern-debug`. Its zh-Hans main-menu
checkpoint uses `fnv1a64-rgb24:33ebd93fb62f99e7`: the corrected FE8CN
descriptor composition changes only the menu pixels while the persisted-locale
and selector-state probes remain unchanged. The former
`fnv1a64-rgb24:0be48d3d7170ba97` is retained as the explicit pre-fix negative
control for the Chinese sheet rendered through the FE8U OAM layout. The
descriptor test pins FE8CN's count, shape, size, position, and tile semantics
against the approved source hash without embedding source-ROM bytes; Japanese,
English, and European scenario oracles remain unchanged.

An authorized source refresh is explicit and recreates only committed indexed
`.png` tile sources and headered `.tsa.bin` inputs plus the generated registry
source:

```bash
make localized-ui-graphics-extract \
  LOCALIZED_UI_GRAPHICS_FE8J_ROOT=/path/to/fireemblem8j \
  LOCALIZED_UI_GRAPHICS_FE8CN_ROM=/path/to/FE8CN.gba

make eu-localization-extract \
  EU_LOCALIZATION_ROM=/path/to/FE8EU\(EnFrDeEsIt\).gba
```

The normal asset rules derive ignored `.4bpp` then `.lz` siblings from PNG
only in the worktree/build path; neither is a committed localized-UI source.
