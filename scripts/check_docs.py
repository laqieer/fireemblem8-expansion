"""Deterministic, stdlib-only Markdown documentation governance checker.

Single authoritative entry point for Issues #7/#17's documentation
governance closure. Verifies, over every tracked (and, in a dev worktree,
untracked-but-not-ignored) file whose extension is one of a small,
explicit, documented set of recognized Markdown extensions
(``RECOGNIZED_MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS`` -- ``.md``, ``.markdown``, ``.mdown``,
``.mkd``, ``.mkdn``, matched case-insensitively) in this repository:

  1. Internal relative links/images resolve to a real in-repo path, and
     ``file.md#anchor`` anchors resolve against a deterministic,
     GitHub-heading-slug-compatible stdlib algorithm (fenced code blocks
     are ignored so pseudo-links inside code samples are never checked).
     This covers both inline (``[text](target)``) and reference-style
     links/images (``[label]: target`` definitions plus ``[text][label]``,
     ``![alt][label]``, and collapsed ``[text][]`` usages): undefined
     labels and broken definition targets are hard findings, never
     silently skipped. Bare shortcut references (``[label]`` with no
     second bracket pair) are not resolved, but any occurrence whose text
     matches an actually-defined label is still reported as an explicit
     "unsupported" finding rather than passing silently.
  2. ``docs/documentation-inventory.md`` is a byte-exact, one-line-per-file
     registry of every Markdown path in the repo, each with an owner, a
     controlled status/category, and a short scope -- no drift allowed in
     either direction (missing or extra entries both fail).
  3. Every external (``http``/``https``) URL occurrence in every Markdown
     file -- including inside inline code spans, but not fenced code
     blocks -- is covered by a host/prefix rule in
     ``docs/external-link-registry.md`` with a controlled status. No
     network access is ever performed; this is registry/syntax coverage
     only.
  4. A small, explicit denylist of previously-real, now-stale phrasing
     (e.g. the pre-rewrite claim that the decomp tutorial lives in
     ``CONTRIBUTING.md``) does not reappear, and every ``make TARGET``
     invocation found in fenced/inline code across all Markdown resolves
     against a *statically parsed* (never executed) Makefile target
     database, so a renamed/removed target fails fast.
  5. Hardcoded ``MODERN_COHORT_*``/``MODERN_ALL_*`` object-count claims
     (a bare "N objects" tally, a resolved ``VAR=N``/``VAR # -> N``
     annotation, or an arithmetic composition like "21 + 3 = 24") do not
     appear anywhere in any Markdown file -- including inside fenced code
     blocks, and regardless of the file's ``docs/documentation-inventory.md``
     status (report/historical/evidence included; there is no status-based
     exemption). Only a live ``make print-<VARIABLE>`` reproduction command
     is allowed to stand in for these counts, since they drift as source
     files are added/removed.
Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 invocation/environment error.

This script performs no network access and never executes a Makefile
recipe (targets are discovered by parsing ``Makefile``/its ``include``
graph as text, not by invoking ``make``). ``--check-examples`` additionally
spawns a small, hardcoded allowlist of zero-ROM/zero-network/zero-mutation
example commands (``--help`` invocations and this script's own
``--help``) to prove they still work; it never executes an arbitrary
command discovered in a doc file.

# MODERN_ALL_* object-count number written *inside* a fenced ```bash/

      ``[x](docs/a(b(c)).md)``). A backslash-escaped ``\\(``/``\\)``
      (``[x](docs/a\\(b\\).md)``) does not affect paren-depth tracking and
      is unescaped in the returned ``target`` (so it round-trips
      correctly through ``resolve_internal_link``'s path lookup);
    - an angle-bracket destination (``[x](<docs/a b.md>)``), which may
      contain literal spaces (percent-encoded spaces in the bare form,
      e.g. ``docs/a%20b.md``, already round-trip correctly via
      ``resolve_internal_link``'s existing ``urllib.parse.unquote``).

    A bare destination that never reaches a closing `)` at the correct
    paren-depth (unbalanced/missing), one whose nesting depth exceeds
    ``MAX_LINK_DESTINATION_PAREN_DEPTH``, or one whose raw length exceeds
    ``MAX_LINK_DESTINATION_CHARS`` before terminating (pathological-input
    guards, not real-world Markdown shapes), an unterminated ``<...>``,
