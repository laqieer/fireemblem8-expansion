"""Top-level release rehearsal CLI (issue #9).

Two subcommands, wired to `make release-check` / `make release-rehearse`:

  check     Build the full release manifest (scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py)
            and print it. By default, exit 0 for any well-formed report --
            the report's own "status" field says "mechanically eligible" or
            "blocked"; both are valid, expected, non-error outcomes of a
            correctly running checker. Exit 2 for an actionable input/
            schema error (a tooling defect, not an honestly-recorded
            unresolved fact).

  rehearse  Run the deterministic double-archive-build + hash-compare
            rehearsal and the clean-rebuild blocker check
            (scripts/release_rehearsal/archive_rehearsal.py), then fold in the
            manifest's provenance/source-guard findings so the exact
            unresolved license/assets/mgfembp inventory is always part of
            the printed report. Never uploads or retains any archive.

Both subcommands additionally accept a **machine-distinct status/exit
contract** (issue #9 verifier remediation) -- no consumer should ever have
to grep prose to learn the outcome:

  --require-eligible     Publication-eligibility gate. Exits
                          EXIT_NOT_ELIGIBLE (1) if the candidate status is
                          not exactly "mechanically eligible" (e.g. it is
                          "blocked", which is this repository's current,
                          expected, correct state); exits 0 only if it
                          truly is eligible.
  --expect-status STATUS Process-health/expected-status gate. STATUS must
                          be exactly "blocked" or "mechanically-eligible"
                          (hyphenated at the CLI layer; mapped internally
                          to the manifest's own "blocked"/"mechanically
                          eligible" strings). Exits 0 only if the actual
                          status matches exactly; exits EXIT_STATUS_
                          MISMATCH (3) on any mismatch. There is no
                          default/implicit value -- the caller must name
                          the exact status they expect, every time.

`--require-eligible` and `--expect-status` are mutually exclusive (each is
its own distinct gate; combining them would make the exit code ambiguous
about which gate failed). Canonical JSON always goes to stdout; every
human-readable diagnostic goes to stderr -- never the reverse -- so a
consumer can always `... | python3 -m json.tool` (or any stdlib
`json.load`) without ever parsing prose.

Exit code contract summary (both subcommands):

  0  the requested gate's own condition is satisfied (plain report mode:
     any well-formed report; --require-eligible: candidate IS eligible;
     --expect-status: actual status matches exactly).
  1  EXIT_NOT_ELIGIBLE -- only reachable via --require-eligible when the
     candidate is not eligible (a truthful, expected "blocked" result is
     not itself an error, but this flag exists precisely to make a
     publication pipeline fail loudly on it).
  2  EXIT_TOOLING_ERROR -- an actionable input/schema defect (checked
     first, before either gate is evaluated).
  3  EXIT_STATUS_MISMATCH -- only reachable via --expect-status when the
     actual status is not the exact one requested.

Never claims "mechanically eligible" while any sub-check actually failed
closed -- see docs/release_process.md's "Exit code contract" section.
