"""Source-release provenance manifests (issue #9; exact-provenance
remediation).

Reads factual, generated JSON provenance manifests from
``docs/release_data/provenance/*.json`` and evaluates whether every entry has a
complete provenance record with redistribution permission recorded: a
non-``NOASSERTION`` author, rightsholder, and license, an explicit
``redistribution_approved: true``, and a named human reviewer. This
module never invents or infers any of those facts -- it only reads what a
human has recorded -- and it never selects or adds a root license, and
its own reported status is never a release/publication approval (see
``evaluate()`` below and docs/release_process.md's "Legal and provenance
boundary" section).

**Exact, one-record-per-member coverage (no directory-prefix semantics).**
An independent review found that this module previously treated a single
category-level entry's ``path`` (e.g. ``"src"``) as covering *every*
allowlisted path nested under it -- an exact-or-directory-prefix
"coverage" relationship. That let a brand-new tracked file, once added to
``docs/release_data/source_allowlist.json``, silently inherit an existing
ancestor directory's provenance record with **no dedicated review
decision of its own**. This module now requires a literal, exact,
one-record-per-member bijection instead: `coverage_gaps`,
`find_ghost_entries`, and `evaluate_coverage` below are pure exact-path
set operations -- an entry's ``path`` covers *only* that exact path,
never any descendant. `find_ambiguous_entries` is kept as a defense-in-
depth hygiene guard that flags a leftover, never-legitimate,
category/directory-style entry (see its own docstring) -- it is not
itself how coverage is granted.

Hand-authoring one near-duplicate ``NOASSERTION`` record per individual
tracked file (thousands of them) would be an unreviewable maintenance
hazard on its own, so `generate_exact_entries()`/`PROVENANCE_ROOT_SEED`
below is the single, small, human-curated generator input (one entry per
reviewable top-level root, exactly as before) that mechanically fans
each root's ``category``/``notes`` out to every exact allowlisted path
nested under (or equal to) it, producing the real, checked-in, exact
per-file JSON this module actually validates. **This prefix-based
fan-out is a one-time/as-needed *generation* step a human explicitly
runs and commits (`generate --write`) -- it is never invoked by, or any
part of, the runtime `check`/`evaluate_coverage` validation path**, which
only ever reads the exact records already committed to disk. Adding a
file to the allowlist without also regenerating (and committing) its
provenance entry is exactly the "new allowlisted file has no exact
provenance" failure this module is designed to catch, not something
`check` ever silently repairs or grants on the fly.

Deliberately dependency-free (Python stdlib only, JSON only).

# record. That is only actually true for `docs/release_data/provenance/
# code.json` itself: it is the "code"-category manifest, so a record
# describing code.json's own oid/sha256 would have to live *inside*
# code.json -- a genuine, structural "hash quine" (the record's content
# would need to embed a hash of code.json's own not-yet-finalized
# content, including that very record). `assets.json` and
# `submodules.json`, by contrast, are NOT self-referential at all: their
# own oid/sha256 identity records live inside code.json (a *different*
# file), so there is no cycle, and (before this fix) exempting them let
# a committed, tampered assets.json/submodules.json silently evade
# identity validation entirely -- exactly the defect this fix closes.
#
# The structural fix: `docs/release_data/provenance/code.json` is now an
# explicit, exact export exclusion (`tree_coverage.
# KIND_SELF_REFERENTIAL_EVIDENCE`, `tree_coverage.
# SELF_REFERENTIAL_EVIDENCE_PATHS`) -- it is no longer an *included*
# allowlist member at all, so it never has (and is never generated with)
# its own provenance record in the first place (see `generate_exact_
# entries`'s `all_paths = allowlist_set | exclusion_set` and
# `scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py`'s narrower, gitlink-only
# `PROVENANCE_REQUIRED_EXCLUSION_KINDS`-filtered required-coverage set).
# There is therefore nothing left to exempt here at all: `check_blob_
# identity` below cross-checks **every** `"code"`/`"asset"`-category
# entry actually present in the loaded data, unconditionally --
# including `assets.json` and `submodules.json` -- with no path-based
# exemption of any kind. A stray, leftover self-entry for code.json

# --- Exact per-file generator (issue #9 exact-provenance remediation) ------
#
# `PROVENANCE_ROOT_SEED` is the single, small, human-curated input: one
# entry per reviewable root. Not every entry is a literal top-level path
# -- `"texts/expansion"` and `"texts/locales"` are exact nested roots, kept
# disjoint from the now-narrowed `"texts/*.txt"` siblings so `_assign_root`
# never sees an overlapping/ambiguous match -- each
# naming the `category`/`notes`/`pinned_commit` every exact allowlisted
# path nested under (or equal to) that root should start out with.
# `generate_exact_entries()` mechanically fans this out to one exact,
# fully-materialized dict per allowlisted path; `main()`'s `generate`
# subcommand is the only thing that ever calls it, and only when a human
# explicitly runs it. Nothing in `check`/`evaluate_coverage` above ever
# calls this generator, and it is never invoked implicitly by
# scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py -- release-time validation only
# ever reads the exact records already committed to disk (see module
# docstring).

    separately -- an independent review correctly flagged this as a
    second, permissive parser of the same trust file
    (`docs/release_data/export_exclusions.json`) that could silently
    drift out of sync with the real, strict one, rather than a provable
    single source of truth.

    This function now performs no schema interpretation of its own at
    all: it delegates entirely to `tree_coverage.load_exclusion_paths()`
    restricted to `tree_coverage.PROVENANCE_REQUIRED_EXCLUSION_KINDS`
    (today exactly `(tree_coverage.KIND_GITLINK,)`) -- the same set
    `scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py`'s `check_provenance` already
    uses to compute this exact narrower "still needs its own separate
    provenance-manifest record" path set (see that constant's docstring
    in `tree_coverage.py`). An arbitrary/uncurated gitlink path, a
    fabricated/null/mismatched `oid`, a wrong mode, a duplicate entry, or
    a `kind == "self_referential_evidence"` row misusing self-evidence
    semantics now all fail here, at this reader, exactly like they
    already failed `tree_coverage.load_exclusions()` itself -- never
    only at a separate composite backstop.

    Returns `[]` if `exclusions_path` does not exist at all (unchanged
    from before this fix). Any schema/curated-policy defect
    `tree_coverage.load_exclusions()` would raise is re-raised here as a
    `ProvenanceError`, so every caller of this function keeps failing
    exactly the same way it always has, just against a strictly correct,
    shared implementation instead of a second, independently
    (re-)implemented one."""
