"""Source-release guard (issue #9).

A separate, purpose-built safety checker for a *candidate source-release
tree or archive*: an exact path set derived by the release caller from the
immutable candidate tree, plus recursive hard-deny rules for prohibited nested content, unsafe
paths, and unsafe non-regular members. This is deliberately independent
of, and does not modify or weaken, ``scripts/artifact_guard.py`` (which
governs ordinary tracked-Git content review, not release-archive safety)
-- see docs/issue-resolution-policy.md and docs/release_process.md.

``scan_tree(..., closed_world=True)`` is the fail-closed check for an
actual, already-materialized release candidate (a genuine extracted
archive/non-git tree): **every individual file is checked against the
exact per-member allowlist** (issue #9 verifier remediation -- there is
no directory/top-level-prefix membership any more: a directory may only
ever be a structural parent to walk through, never something whose mere
presence in the allowlist authorizes every file nested under it). A
*live git development worktree* is not that -- it routinely contains
gitignored/untracked build byproducts alongside the real source -- so
``scan_source_release_candidate()`` instead evaluates exactly the
git-tracked-intersect-allowlist candidate set that
``scripts/release_rehearsal/archive_rehearsal.py`` itself would archive
(``git_tracked_allowlisted_files()``, itself exact-per-path), applying
every hard-deny rule to that exact set, and transparently falls back to
the closed-world ``scan_tree`` check when there is no ``.git`` at all.
This is what ``scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py``'s source_guard
check uses, so a manifest built against the live worktree is
deterministic and host-state-independent while a manifest built against a
genuine extracted archive still fails closed.

Hard-deny coverage (path/extension and file-magic, independent of each
other -- a misleading extension never hides prohibited content, and a
"safe" extension never excuses prohibited magic bytes):

* object/library/executable/debug-symbol artifacts: ``.o .obj .a .lib
  .so`` (including versioned/shared variants like ``.so.1.2.3``) ``.dll
  .dylib .exe .elf .pdb`` and ``.dSYM`` debug-symbol bundles;
* generic archive/compression containers, including Java/JVM archive
  variants: ``.zip .jar .war .ear .tar .tar.gz .tgz .gz .bz2 .xz .7z
  .rar``;
* GBA ROM/save-state/patch artifacts (pre-existing): ``.gba .elf .sav
  .srm .sa1 .sa2 .savestate .state .gpstate .ips .ups .bps .ppf .xdelta
  .xdelta3 .vcdiff``;
* arbitrary build ``.map``/``.hex`` output -- denied by default; the
  *only* way a ``.map``/``.hex`` path is ever accepted is an exact,
  file-level entry in ``docs/release_data/map_hex_exceptions.json`` with a
  recorded factual rationale (see ``load_map_hex_exceptions`` below) --
  there is no directory-level or extension-level carve-out.

File-magic detection (``classify_magic``) is content-based and applies
regardless of extension or nesting depth, so a prohibited archive/
executable smuggled under an innocuous name or nested arbitrarily deep
inside an otherwise-allowlisted directory is still caught: ELF, PE
(``MZ``)/Mach-O executables, Java ``.class``/Mach-O fat-binary
(``CAFEBABE``), ZIP (including JAR/WAR/EAR, which are ZIP files), Unix
``ar`` (``.a``/``.lib``/``.deb``), gzip, bzip2, xz, 7z, rar, zstd, POSIX/
GNU ``tar`` (``ustar`` magic at offset 257), and the pre-existing GBA ROM
header/patch-format magics. ``classify_zip_structure`` additionally
recognizes a ZIP **regardless of any arbitrary prefix** before its local
file headers (e.g. a self-extracting archive) via bounded, read-only
stdlib End-Of-Central-Directory/central-directory parsing -- never
extraction -- so an offset-0-only magic check can never be the only
thing standing between a prefixed ZIP and this guard.

Deliberately dependency-free (Python stdlib only).

Exit codes (CLI): 0 clean, 1 hard-deny violation(s) found, 2
invocation/I/O error.

# --- Structural, prefix-tolerant ZIP detection (issue #9: prefixed/self-
# extracting ZIPs) -----------------------------------------------------
# `classify_magic` above only ever inspects the *first* `MAGIC_READ_BYTES`
# bytes, so it only ever catches a ZIP whose local file header happens to
# start at byte 0. The ZIP format itself never requires that: every real
# ZIP reader (including this one) locates the archive purely by scanning
# *backwards* from the end for the End-Of-Central-Directory (EOCD)
# record, so an arbitrary prefix before the "real" ZIP data is always a
# structurally valid ZIP -- a self-extracting archive (native stub, then
# ZIP data appended) is the canonical legitimate real-world example of
# exactly this shape. An offset-0-only magic check is therefore not
# sufficient to catch a prohibited ZIP smuggled behind any nonzero-length
# prefix, however it got there (full filesystem file, tar member, or any
# other complete byte stream/blob).
PROHIBITED_ZIP_STRUCTURE = "prohibited-magic-zip-archive"
PROHIBITED_ZIP_STRUCTURE_MALFORMED = "prohibited-magic-zip-archive-malformed"


def classify_zip_structure(source):
    """Structural (never magic-byte/extension-only) ZIP detection that
    recognizes a valid ZIP archive **regardless of any arbitrary prefix**
    before its local file headers, using only bounded, read-only stdlib
    `zipfile` EOCD/central-directory parsing -- never an extraction call,
    and never proportional to `source`'s own size beyond the ZIP format's
    own fixed caps (`zipfile.is_zipfile` only ever scans a <=64KiB+22-byte
    tail window for a consistent End-Of-Central-Directory record --
    including the Zip64 EOCD locator -- and the subsequent central-
    directory parse below is itself bounded by, and validated against,
    that same EOCD record's own declared offsets/sizes, so a forged EOCD
    claiming an implausible size/offset fails fast rather than attempting
    a large read; verified directly against a hostile crafted EOCD).

    `source` may be a `bytes`/`bytearray` immutable blob (wrapped in an
    in-memory `io.BytesIO`) or any already-open, seekable, readable binary
    file-like object representing a *complete* byte range -- an ordinary
    filesystem file opened with `open(path, "rb")`, or a
    `tarfile.TarFile.extractfile()` member stream (itself fully seekable
    over exactly that member's own bytes, never the whole enclosing tar).
    Both forms share this exact same code path, so a raw blob, a
    filesystem file, and a tar member are all recognized identically and
    uniformly -- this is what `_hard_deny_check_file` and
    `scan_archive_members` below both call. The stream's read position is
    not guaranteed on return.

    Returns one of two disjoint prohibited-rule strings, or ``None``:

    * `PROHIBITED_ZIP_STRUCTURE` -- a fully valid ZIP central directory
      was parsed. Identical rule name/severity to the pre-existing
      offset-0 `classify_magic` ZIP finding: a prefixed ZIP is exactly as
      prohibited as an unprefixed one, never a lesser finding.
    * `PROHIBITED_ZIP_STRUCTURE_MALFORMED` -- a consistent EOCD record
      was found (so `source` *structurally claims* to be a ZIP) but its
      own declared central directory then failed to parse (corrupt/
      truncated/inconsistent). This is a deliberate fail-closed verdict:
      once something has structurally claimed to be a ZIP, it is never
      silently reinterpreted as ordinary data merely because it also
      turns out to be broken -- a malformed claim is still denied, not
      waved through.
    * ``None`` -- no EOCD record consistent with `source`'s own actual
      length is present anywhere in the tail window at all, i.e. this is
      ordinary, non-ZIP data. Data that merely happens to contain stray
      `PK`/EOCD-*looking* bytes without ever satisfying the format's own
      internal offset/size consistency rule is never misclassified as a
      ZIP by this alone (though another independent rule, e.g. a
      prohibited extension, may still separately deny it).

    Never decrypts, decompresses, or reads a single byte of any entry's
    actual payload data: `zipfile.ZipFile`'s constructor parses only EOCD
    + central-directory *metadata* (names, compressed/uncompressed
    sizes, CRCs, general-purpose flag bits, offsets) -- so an encrypted
    entry (flag bit 0 set), a data-descriptor entry (flag bit 3 set,
    meaning CRC/sizes trail the entry's *local* header instead of
    preceding it -- irrelevant here since only the always-complete
    *central*-directory copy of that same metadata is ever consulted),
    and a Zip64-extended entry are all ordinary, still-valid -- still
    just as prohibited -- ZIP structures under this policy; none of them
    is ever a reason to attempt decryption/decompression, and none is
    ever treated as a policy exemption."""

    *tracked* files restricted to the allowlist -- never a raw filesystem
    walk. This is deliberately preferred over walking the live filesystem
    whenever git metadata is available: a development worktree routinely
    contains gitignored, host-built byproducts (compiled host tool
    binaries under tools/*/, stale build/ output, a built ROM/ELF, .dep/
    dependency files, etc.) that must never end up in a "source" release
    candidate even though they may sit inside an otherwise-allowlisted
    directory; git itself already knows, precisely and deterministically,
    which files are the actual tracked source.

    `allowlist` is matched *exactly*, one tracked relative path per entry
    (the exact-per-member allowlist -- see
    docs/release_data/source_allowlist.json); a tracked file whose path is
    not itself present in `allowlist` is excluded from the returned list
    exactly like an untracked file would be (this is what makes a new,
    unlisted tracked file invisible to an archive build -- the manifest's
    separate `allowlist_check` module is what turns that into an
    actionable failure instead of a silent omission). Returns None (not a
    list) when `root` has no `.git` (an extracted archive/non-git tree),
    so the caller falls back to a real filesystem walk instead.

    Deliberately still includes a tracked *symlink* (or any other tracked
    non-directory path) in the returned list rather than silently
    dropping it: only an actual real directory on disk (a submodule
    gitlink mountpoint such as "mgfembp", which `git ls-files` also lists
    as its own path) is excluded here, so that a tracked malicious/unsafe
    symlink still reaches the caller's own hard-deny check
    (`_hard_deny_check_file`, which lstat()s -- never follows -- the path
    and flags a symlink as "prohibited-symlink") instead of vanishing
    from the candidate set entirely. Ignoring *untracked* content must
    never become a blind spot for *tracked* content.

    This is the single, shared candidate-enumeration used by both
    scripts/release_rehearsal/archive_rehearsal.py (to build the actual
    release archive) and scan_source_release_candidate() below (so
    scripts/release_rehearsal/manifest.py's source_guard check evaluates
