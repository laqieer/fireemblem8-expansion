"""Immutable Git-object content source (issue #9 verifier remediation).

A release-candidate archive must never be built from mutable worktree
bytes: a tracked file can be edited on disk (or staged) without being
committed, and a naive "read the file from the checkout" archive builder
would silently pick up those bytes even though they are not part of any
commit. This module is the fix: it reads a repository's tree structure
and blob *content* exclusively through Git's plumbing porcelain
(``git ls-tree``, ``git cat-file --batch``), keyed by an exact commit SHA,
so the resulting bytes are bound to that immutable commit object and are
provably independent of the current worktree/index state.

Deliberately dependency-free (Python stdlib ``subprocess`` only).

Git blob modes this module understands (``git ls-tree``'s first column):

* ``100644`` -- an ordinary regular file (not executable).
* ``100755`` -- an executable regular file.
* ``120000`` -- a symlink (the blob content is the link target text).
  Never safe to archive as regular file content -- see
  ``source_guard.py``'s existing symlink hard-deny policy, which this
  module's callers apply identically to git-sourced entries.
* ``160000`` -- a gitlink (submodule mountpoint); the "object id" is the
  pinned commit SHA of the submodule, not a blob -- there is no blob
  content to read at all, by design (see docs/release_process.md's
  submodule/provenance boundary).

Any other mode (e.g. a raw ``040000`` tree entry, which ``-r`` recursion
should never surface) is treated as unsafe/unrecognized and rejected by
the caller rather than silently skipped.

# boundary fix) -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The version ledger's own `previous_supported_version` field
# (docs/release_data/version_ledger.json) is candidate-controlled and
# purely *descriptive* -- it must never itself be treated as the
# authoritative source of "what was actually released before this
# candidate". This section is that actual authority: it derives the true
# immediate SemVer predecessor exclusively from this repository's own
# real, immutable, **annotated** `refs/tags/expansion/MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
# release-tag history (never from the ledger, never from any other
# candidate-writable source) -- see consistency.py's
# `check_release_tag_authority`, which cross-checks the ledger's
# descriptive claim against this authority and fails closed on any
# disagreement.
#
# A **lightweight** tag under this reserved namespace is never accepted
# at all (it can be silently moved/recreated by anyone with push access,
# unlike an annotated tag object, which is itself an immutable,
# addressable Git object with its own SHA) -- nor is a malformed tag name
# (anything other than an exact `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version under the
# namespace), nor an ambiguous duplicate-version alias (two refs whose
# names both parse to the same version but name different commits). Any
# of these is a release-tag *authority-integrity* defect -- raised as
# `ReleaseTagAuthorityError`, never silently skipped/ignored in favor of
# whatever tags *do* happen to be well-formed (that would let a single
# malformed/lightweight tag quietly make an otherwise-real predecessor
# invisible, or vice versa).
#
# Only a tag whose peeled commit is reachable from the candidate's own
# `target_sha` (is `target_sha` itself, or a genuine ancestor of it) is
# ever considered a real predecessor candidate -- a tag that exists but
# sits on an unrelated/divergent history (e.g. a different release
# branch, or history that has since been rewritten) is never silently
# treated as this candidate's predecessor merely because its version
# number is numerically lower.
