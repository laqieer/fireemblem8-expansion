"""Read-only-publishing workflow permission/safety checker (issue #9).

A small, targeted text-based checker (deliberately not a general YAML
parser -- stdlib-only, no PyYAML dependency) for exactly the constraints
`.github/workflows/release-rehearsal.yml` must satisfy: read-only
top-level/job-level/nested permissions, no credential persistence, no
secrets/token interpolation, no tag/release/asset/comment/environment
mutation, no artifact upload, no network publish/upload/download
commands, a pinned/accepted `actions/checkout` reference, and (when
present) one exact successful-Build-CI-on-master `workflow_run` contract.

Conservative and fail-closed by construction: every check here is a
structured/line-aware substring or regex match, never a full YAML/shell
parse, so an ambiguous or unusual construct this module cannot fully
understand is far more likely to trip a rule (a false positive an author
must then justify/rephrase) than to silently slip through (a false
negative). See docs/release_process.md.

Exit codes (CLI): 0 clean, 1 violation(s) found, 2 invocation/I/O error.

# --- Canonical `uses:` occurrence extraction (fail-closed workflow/
# action-pin parsing hardening) ------------------------------------------
#
# The previous implementation here was a single line-anchored regex
# (`^\s*(?:-\s*)?uses:\s*(\S+)`, one match per *line*, MULTILINE): it only
# ever recognized a bare, unquoted `uses:` key sitting at the very start
# of a line (optionally after a single `-\s*` list-item marker). Two
# independent code-review findings showed that shape covers only the
# "happy path" YAML this repository's own real workflow happens to use,
# and is trivially bypassed by other, equally-valid YAML spellings of
# exactly the same key/value pair:
#
#   * a flow mapping step, e.g. `- {uses: actions/checkout@mutable}` or
#     `- {"uses": "actions/checkout@mutable"}` -- the key never sits at
#     column 0 (or right after a bare `-\s*`), so the old regex's `^`
#     anchor never matched it at all: a mutable ref hidden inside a flow
#     mapping silently passed every check below.
#   * a quoted key in block style, e.g. `"uses": ...` / `'uses': ...` --
#     the old regex only ever matched the bare word `uses`, never a
#     quoted spelling of it.
#   * a quoted *value*, e.g. `uses: "actions/checkout@mutable"` -- the
#     old regex's `(\S+)` captured the value *including* its
#     surrounding quote characters, which then never matched
#     `_USES_REF_SPLIT_RE` (a literal `"` is not part of any real action
#     name), so `check_uses_pins` silently treated it as a "no @ref at
#     all" case instead of validating the real, quoted pin underneath.
#
# This module deliberately still never depends on PyYAML (or any other
# new dependency) and never executes/evaluates any YAML or template --
# see the module docstring. Instead, `extract_uses_occurrences` below is
# a single, well-defined, structural *subset* scanner: a hand-written,
# character-by-character reader that understands exactly the YAML
# constructs a `uses:` key/value pair can legally appear in (block
# mapping, flow mapping, single/double-quoted keys and values, line
# comments, and enough indentation-/bracket-depth-aware nesting to tell
# one mapping scope apart from another for duplicate-key detection) --
# and explicitly, individually flags (rather than silently skipping)
# every construct it does not fully, unambiguously understand: a YAML
# anchor (`&name`) or an explicit tag (`!!str`, `!foo`) attached to the
# value, a YAML alias (`*name`) as the value, a GitHub Actions
# expression/template (`${{ ... }}`) anywhere in the value, an
# unterminated or multi-line quoted scalar, an unquoted `:` followed by
# whitespace inside a plain value (a strong sign of an unintended nested
# mapping key -- YAML's own plain-scalar grammar treats it exactly the
# same way), and a duplicate `uses` key repeated within the same
# enclosing mapping (block or flow). None of these ever "pass" -- every
# one of them produces a `problem`-tagged `UsesOccurrence` that
# `check_uses_pins` (below) always reports as a hard violation,
# regardless of what text happens to follow. This is the single,
# canonical extractor: `workflow_guard.check_uses_pins`,
# `check_checkout_pin`, `check_dangerous_uses_actions`, and
# `scripts/release_rehearsal/action_pins.py` (via
# `extract_uses_occurrences`) all share this one implementation -- there
# is exactly one definition, repository-wide, of what a `uses:`
# reference looks like and how to find every occurrence of one.
#
# Every physical `uses:` occurrence is yielded independently (never
# collapsed/deduplicated by action name) -- callers that need an
# action-name-keyed view (e.g. `action_pins.py`'s inventory cross-check)
# are responsible for grouping this module's occurrence list themselves,
# preserving every individual occurrence (see that module's own
# `workflow_external_occurrences`) -- this scanner itself never discards
# or overwrites one occurrence with another.

# --- Canonical YAML quoted-scalar semantic decoder (issue #9 semantic-
# decoding hardening) -----------------------------------------------
#
# A fresh, independent verifier reproduced a real fail-open bypass: this
# decoder previously only ever recognized a small, ad-hoc subset of YAML
# double-quote escapes (`\"`, `\\`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\0`) and silently
# passed *any other* escaped character straight through unchanged (a
# lossy "just use the raw character" fallback for e.g. `\x`, `\u`, `\U`,
# or any other letter). Two independent, real-world consequences follow
# directly from that: (1) a `uses:`/`permissions:`/`contents:` *key* or
# *value* spelled with a `\uXXXX`/`\xXX`/`\UXXXXXXXX` escape (e.g. the
# key `"u\u0073es"`, which every real YAML parser decodes to exactly the
# same string as the plain key `uses`) was never recognized as
# equivalent to its unescaped spelling at all, so a mutable/dangerous
# `uses:` reference or a `contents: write` grant hidden behind such an
# escape silently evaded every check below; (2) a genuinely malformed,
# truncated, unknown, or out-of-range/surrogate escape was silently
# "decoded" into a plausible-looking (but semantically wrong) literal
# character instead of being rejected, which is exactly backwards for a
# security-relevant, fail-closed parser: an unrecognized construct must
# never be silently accepted.
#
# This is now a complete, stdlib-only (no PyYAML, no `unicode_escape`
# shortcut -- that stdlib codec is a *Python* string-literal decoder, not
# a YAML one: it does not implement YAML's own escape table, silently
# accepts several escapes YAML does not define, and cannot be made to
# reject an invalid/surrogate Unicode scalar value on demand) YAML
# double-quoted escape decoder, exactly matching the YAML 1.2 spec's own
# "Escaped Characters" table (5.7): `\0 \a \b \t \n \v \f \r \e \  \" \/
# \\ \N \_ \L \P`, plus `\xXX` / `\uXXXX` / `\UXXXXXXXX` hex escapes.
# Every one of those -- and *only* those -- decodes; anything else after
# a backslash (an unknown escape letter, a truncated or non-hex `\x`/
# `\u`/`\U` sequence, or a hex escape whose codepoint is a UTF-16
# surrogate (U+D800-U+DFFF, never a valid standalone Unicode scalar
# value) or exceeds U+10FFFF) is rejected fail-closed -- reported back
# to the caller via `problem="invalid-escape"` -- rather than lossily
# decoded or silently passed through. Single-quoted scalars only ever
# support YAML's own `''`-escapes-to-`'` rule (spec 7.3.1); a bare
# backslash inside a single-quoted scalar is always literal (YAML never
# defines an escape there), exactly as before. Neither quote style
# supports a folded/continued value across multiple physical lines --
# an unclosed scalar at end-of-line/end-of-text always fails closed as
# `"unterminated-quote"`, exactly as before this hardening.

# A fresh, independent verifier reproduced a dangerous command name
# assembled at *runtime* from two or more concatenated shell variable
# expansions in command position -- e.g. `X=cur; Y=l; $X$Y
# https://example.invalid` actually executes `curl ...` even though the
# literal substring "curl" never appears anywhere in the workflow file,
# so no substring/regex rule in `FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS` above can ever
# match it. This is a narrow, deliberately conservative, command-
# position/assignment-aware heuristic -- not a shell parser -- covering
# exactly the high-confidence shapes issue #9 names: `$X$Y`, `${X}${Y}`
# (and any bare/braced mix, 2 or more fragments), concatenated with zero
# intervening whitespace; and a single shell variable invoked directly
# as a command after being locally assigned a literal value earlier in
# the very same script (`CMD=curl` ... `$CMD https://...` -- no
# assembly needed, just one layer of indirection).
#
# This must never flag this real workflow's own safe, ordinary
# `>> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"` job-summary redirection, nor ordinary
# non-command data interpolation (e.g. `echo "$A$B"`): both sit *after*
# the actual command name, never *at* command position, which is
# exactly what "command position" (defined below) excludes.

    """Collapses a POSIX shell line-continuation (a trailing backslash at
    end-of-line) into a single logical line before any pattern match runs,
    exactly like a real shell would when it actually executes a `run:`
    script -- the backslash and the newline are removed entirely (never
    replaced with a space), so a dangerous command split across two YAML
    lines, at *any* point including mid-token (a simple, common evasion
    of a naive single-line substring/regex check), cannot slip past
    `FORBIDDEN_PATTERNS`/checkout-pin checks.

    This also consumes (discards) any leading indentation -- spaces or
    tabs -- at the start of the continuation line itself. That mirrors
    the two layers of real semantics that actually apply to a `run: |`
    step: (1) a YAML block-scalar strips every line's *common* leading
    indentation before the shell ever sees the script text, so an
    equally-indented continuation line (the realistic, common-looking
    shape an author -- or an adversary -- actually writes) reaches the
    shell with *no* leading whitespace of its own, and (2) POSIX shell
    backslash-newline splicing then joins the (now-dedented) lines with
    no separator inserted. Skipping the indentation-consumption step
    would leave the continuation line's raw *YAML source* indentation
    sitting literally inside the joined line -- e.g. `gh rel\\` followed
    by an indented `ease create ...` would normalize to `gh rel
    ease create ...` (still two separate whitespace-separated words, so
    `\\bgh\\s+release\\b` never matches) instead of the actual executed
    `gh release create ...` (a single, dangerous `gh release`
    invocation). Handles CRLF line endings the same way. This is
