"""Deterministic archive and rebuild rehearsal (issue #9).

Builds a canonical, deterministic source-tar rehearsal **twice** into
separate temporary directories, compares their SHA-256 hashes, and always
removes both temporary archives/directories afterwards -- on success or
failure. Never uploads or retains anything, and never extracts an archive
unsafely (see scripts/release_rehearsal/source_guard.py, used here to pre-screen
every path before it is added to the archive).

**Immutable, HEAD-bound archive inputs.** When `root` is a real Git
working tree, every byte that goes into the archive is read exclusively
through Git plumbing (`scripts/release_rehearsal/git_source.py`'s
`git ls-tree`/`git cat-file --batch` wrappers), keyed to an exact,
resolved commit SHA -- **never** by opening the file at its worktree path.
A tracked file edited on disk (or even `git add`ed) without being
committed therefore cannot change one single byte of the archive: the
archive is bound to the commit, not the checkout. Only when `root` has no
`.git` at all (a genuine already-extracted archive/non-git candidate
tree -- the tree *is* the candidate, not a development worktree with
byproducts alongside it) does this fall back to a raw filesystem walk of
exactly the allowlisted entries.

Also rehearses (and, when infeasible, precisely reports the blocker for) a
clean recursive local clone/rebuild, and explicitly documents the
contradiction that a GitHub auto-generated source archive (Constants
"Source code (zip)"/"(tar.gz)") does not include submodule contents and
therefore cannot be the supported complete source artifact for this
repository (which has the `mgfembp` git submodule). The rebuild rehearsal
never describes a rebuild as proved when it was not actually executed --
see `REBUILD_STATUS_*` below.

tempfile, subprocess, shutil).

# The one, safe, public, documented, deterministic interface a future
# ready candidate's rebuild rehearsal actually executes through --
# never a free-form shell string accepted from a CLI flag (which would
# reopen the exact "shell command string" hazard issue #9 forbids). This
# is a plain argv list (`subprocess.run(..., shell=False)` -- see
# `run_build_twice_from_immutable_source`) naming the exact, already-
# existing, ordinary `make` targets/knobs this repository's own
# modern.mk defines (MODERN_CONFIG/MODERN_ABI/MODERN_ROM_SIZE -- the
# same three knobs `cli.py`'s own `--config`/`--abi`/`--rom-size`
# options already expose), never a new, bespoke build path invented only
# for this rehearsal. `-j1` is deliberately pinned (never left to the
# ambient `MAKEFLAGS`/nproc) so the rehearsal's own two independent runs
# never depend on host parallelism/scheduling for determinism.
#
# This profile is only ever reached once `evaluate_rebuild_eligibility`
# has already reported this candidate ready (mgfembp initialized,
# identity-matched, provenance-approved, clean) -- today, and until a
# human resolves that provenance record, it is unconditionally
# `REBUILD_STATUS_FAILED` before a single byte of this profile is ever
# read, exactly as `docs/release_process.md`'s "Legal and provenance
# boundary" documents. Wiring it in now (rather than leaving the
# ready path an unexecuted stub) is what makes a *future* ready
# run actually run two real, hermetic, independently-materialized builds
# instead of merely describing that it would.

    """Returns an `extra_materialize` callback (see
    `run_build_twice_from_immutable_source`) that materializes
    `submodule_path`'s content into each independent materialization from
    the submodule's own **immutable Git object** at `pinned_commit` --
    never from its live, potentially-dirty worktree bytes.

    issue #9 guardian-correction remediation (D3): the previous version
    of this function (`_copy_verified_submodule_content`) used
    `shutil.copytree` on the submodule's own checked-out *worktree*
    directory. `evaluate_rebuild_eligibility` confirming the submodule's
    HEAD commit matches the pinned gitlink is not the same fact as "the
    worktree bytes exactly equal that commit's tree": a modified,
    staged, or untracked file can sit in an otherwise commit-matching
    checkout, and copying that live directory would silently carry those
    extra/changed bytes into a rebuild that is then reported
    `verified_success` over tampered content -- an independent review
    reproduced exactly this. `evaluate_rebuild_eligibility` now also
    requires the submodule worktree/index to be genuinely clean before
    eligibility is ever granted at all (defense #1) -- but this function
    is independent defense #2: even if eligibility were ever wrongly
    granted by a future bug, this materializer itself never reads a
    single byte from the submodule's worktree path; it always extracts
    `pinned_commit`'s own immutable tree via `git archive
    <pinned_commit> | tar -x`, run with the submodule's own directory as
    the *source repository* (`materialize_immutable_source_tree`, the
    exact same immutable-extraction mechanism already used for the
    superproject's own content) -- so the materialized bytes are
    provably bound to the pinned commit object, never to whatever
    happens to be checked out on disk right now. `git archive` never
    includes submodule content in the *superproject's own* archive at
    all (see `GITHUB_AUTOARCHIVE_SUBMODULE_CONTRADICTION`), so this is
    the one, narrow, explicitly-gated exception to "everything comes
    from the superproject's own `git archive`" -- it still never reads
    the submodule's worktree, only its own object database."""
