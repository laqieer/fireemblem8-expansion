"""Host-side expansion save-format inspection/validation/migration tool
(issue #2 slice 1).

This is a byte-exact Python mirror of the raw-byte compatibility classifier
implemented in C (include/save_format.h's enum SaveCompatState, and its
real logic in src/bmsave-lib.c's ClassifySaveCompatRaw()/
ClassifySramSaveCompat()). Any change to the classifier's precedence order
or field layout MUST be applied to both places -- see docs/save_format.md's
"Known infrastructure gaps" section, which explains why this mirror exists
instead of executing the shipped GBA C code directly (no emulator/host
execution path is available for that code in this repository).

Deliberately dependency-free (Python stdlib only), matching this
repository's existing scripts/modernize/*.py tools.

Commands
--------

  inspect <path>            Print the classification and every diagnostic
                             field of a raw 0x8000-byte SRAM image. Never
                             fails on classification itself, only on I/O.

  validate <path> [--expect STATE ...]
                             Exit non-zero if the image's classification is
                             not one of the given --expect states (default:
                             SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT).

  migrate <source> <dest>   Out-of-place migration only. Refuses
                             source == destination -- by resolved canonical
                             path (catches symlink and relative-path
                             aliases) and, separately, by device+inode
                             identity via os.path.samefile() (catches hard
                             link aliases, which are a distinct path that
                             resolve() alone cannot detect) -- regardless
                             of --force in both cases, since --force only
                             governs overwriting an unrelated existing
                             destination, never migrating a source onto
                             itself. Refuses an existing (unrelated)
                             destination unless --force is given. Reads the
                             full source image into host memory, classifies
                             it, and only migrates a
                             SAVE_COMPAT_VALID_LEGACY_OR_VANILLA,
                             SAVE_COMPAT_MIGRATABLE_OLDER, or already-
                             SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT source: no metadata record
                             at all -> a current, checksummed one (v0 ->
                             current); an older-but-supported formatVersion
                             -> current (issue #18 sprint 2); or a no-op
                             re-migration of an already-current source. A
                             source classified SAVE_COMPAT_VALID_LEGACY_OR_
                             VANILLA has no prior ExpansionSaveMeta.reserved
                             to preserve, so it gets a fresh default
                             ExpansionUserPrefs record
                             (include/expansion_save_prefs.h); any other
                             migratable source's existing `reserved` bytes
                             (which may hold a real, player-stored
                             ExpansionUserPrefs record) are carried forward
                             verbatim -- migration only ever refreshes
                             formatVersion/compatEpoch/diagnostics/checksum,
                             never a real stored user preference. Every
                             other source classification is a precondition
                             failure: neither the source nor any
                             destination file is touched. Before publishing,
                             the in-memory migrated image is re-classified
                             and must come back SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT, or the
                             migration is aborted with nothing written. The
                             destination is published atomically: the full
                             image is written to a temporary file in the
                             destination's directory, flushed and fsync'd,
                             then re-read and re-verified byte-for-byte and
                             by classification. Publication itself is then
                             OS-enforced, not merely precondition-checked:
                             without --force, the temp file is published via
                             os.link(temp, dest), an atomic fail-if-exists
                             operation, so even a destination created by a
                             concurrent writer strictly after the early
                             existence precheck above still causes the
                             publish itself to fail (exit code 7) rather
                             than clobbering it; with --force, the temp file
                             is published via os.replace(temp, dest), which
                             unconditionally and atomically overwrites any
                             existing destination. Either way, the temporary
                             file is always removed afterwards (whether
                             publish succeeded, lost the no-force race, or
                             failed outright), destination is never opened
                             for writing directly, and any I/O failure --
                             including tempfile.mkstemp() itself failing --
                             is handled deterministically rather than
                             propagating an uncaught exception; the
                             published destination is re-read and
                             re-verified once more after a successful
                             publish.

Exit codes
----------

  0   success
  1   I/O error (file not found, unreadable, unwritable, wrong size,
      temp-file creation/write/publish failure, ...)
  2   argparse usage error (reserved by Python's argparse; not raised here)
  3   validate: classification not in the accepted --expect set
  4   migrate: source classification is not migratable
  5   migrate: post-migration re-verification did not come back CURRENT
  6   migrate: source and destination are the same file (refused),
      either by resolved canonical path (symlink/relative-path alias)
      or by device+inode identity (hard-link alias); enforced
      regardless of --force
  7   migrate: destination already exists (refused; pass --force to
      overwrite). Raised either by the early precondition check or by the
      OS-enforced os.link() publish itself losing a race against a
      concurrently created destination -- either way the destination is
      left completely untouched.
  8   migrate: an explicit --to-epoch/--to-format-version/
      --to-compat-epoch is out of the mechanically supported range, or
      an invalid combination of these three was given (e.g.
      --to-format-version without --to-compat-epoch, or --to-epoch
      combined with either); refused before any file is read, nothing
      written.

--to-epoch / --to-format-version / --to-compat-epoch / --expect (migrate,
issue #9 residual-hardening + formatVersion/compatEpoch pair modeling)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  By default, migrate always stamps whatever is *live* today
  (SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION_CURRENT / config.mk's own
  EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH) -- unchanged historic behavior for every
  bare `migrate SOURCE DEST` invocation.

  formatVersion and compatEpoch are two independent on-media fields
  (struct ExpansionSaveMeta, include/save_format.h) -- classify_save_
  compat_raw() only ever compares compatEpoch at all once formatVersion
  has already resolved to SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT; nothing in this tool may
  assume the two are numerically equal for any future transition just
  because today's two registered registry entries happen to declare
  matching pairs (formatVersion 1/compatEpoch 1, formatVersion
  2/compatEpoch 2). Two independent, explicit ways to declare a target
  are supported:

  * `--to-format-version FV --to-compat-epoch CE` -- the precise,
    decoupled contract: stamps exactly formatVersion FV and compatEpoch
    CE, independently validated and independently re-verified after
    migration. Must always be given together (an explicit target must
    declare both fields exactly, never leave the other to be assumed);
    FV must be between 1 and the live SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION_CURRENT
    inclusive, CE between 1 and the live config.mk
    EXPANSION_SAVE_COMPAT_EPOCH inclusive.
  * `--to-epoch N` -- a backward-compatible shorthand, truthfully
    documented as exactly that: stamps the same numeric value N into
    *both* formatVersion and compatEpoch (1 <= N <= SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION_
    CURRENT). Mutually exclusive with --to-format-version/
    --to-compat-epoch -- never silently combined or reinterpreted.

  Either way, a formatVersion target below the live current classifies
  SAVE_COMPAT_MIGRATABLE_OLDER (never SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT -- that would
  misrepresent an intentionally older, honest target); a formatVersion
  target at the live current whose compatEpoch does not match the live
  config classifies SAVE_COMPAT_SAVE_CONFIG_INCOMPATIBLE (truthfully,
  never silently coerced to SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT). Both the produced
  formatVersion *and* compatEpoch raw fields are independently
  re-verified against the declared target -- both before publish (the
  in-memory rebuilt image) and once more after publish (the actual bytes
  read back from the published destination) -- not merely an overall
  classifier state, which alone cannot tell two different exact numbered
  pairs sharing the same broad bucket apart. `--expect STATE` (repeatable)
  narrows which source classification(s) this specific invocation
  accepts, instead of the generic MIGRATABLE_SOURCE_STATES default --
  used by scripts/modernize/migrations/registry.py to enforce one
  declared transition's *exact* epoch_from precondition (e.g. exactly
  SAVE_COMPAT_VALID_LEGACY_OR_VANILLA for its "no epoch" -> 1 entry,
  never also SAVE_COMPAT_MIGRATABLE_OLDER or SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT) rather
  than accepting any broadly-migratable source regardless of which
  transition was asked for; registry.py additionally, independently
  re-reads and compares the source's own raw formatVersion *and*
  compatEpoch fields against the declared step's exact source pair
  before ever invoking this tool at all -- a broad --expect bucket match
  alone is not sufficient proof of the exact source epoch pair.

    """Writes `payload` to `dest` atomically and non-destructively.

    `required_state` (issue #9 residual-hardening): the exact
    classification `payload` must re-verify as, both before and after
    publish. Defaults to `SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT`, this function's original
    and only behavior for every pre-existing caller. `cmd_migrate()`
    passes an explicit, non-`CURRENT` `required_state` only for a
    validated `--to-epoch` target strictly below the live
    `SAVE_FORMAT_VERSION_CURRENT` -- such an image genuinely cannot ever
    classify `SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT` against today's live config (that
    would misrepresent it), so demanding `SAVE_COMPAT_CURRENT`
    unconditionally here would make an honestly-older declared target
    unpublishable even when byte-for-byte correct.

    Writes to a temporary file in dest's own directory (so the publish
    step below is on the same filesystem and therefore atomic), flushes
    and fsyncs it, re-reads and re-verifies it byte-for-byte and by
    classification, then publishes it onto `dest`:

    * Without `force`: via os.link(tmp, dest), an OS-enforced, atomic
      fail-if-exists operation. If `dest` is created by anyone else at
      any point up to and including this exact syscall -- including
      strictly *after* an earlier Python-level dest.exists() precheck
      already observed it as absent -- os.link() itself raises
      FileExistsError and `dest` (whatever the concurrent writer put
      there) is left completely untouched; only this function's own
      temporary file is ever removed afterwards. This is deliberately
      not an exists()-then-write() sequence (which has a
      time-of-check-to-time-of-use race window); the no-clobber
      guarantee lives at the actual publish syscall, not merely in an
      earlier precondition check.
    * With `force`: via os.replace(tmp, dest), which atomically
      overwrites any existing destination unconditionally.

    The temporary file is always removed on every path (rename success,
    hard-link success, lost EEXIST race, or any other failure), and
    `dest` is never opened for writing directly -- so an interrupted,
    failed, or raced publish can never leave a truncated/partial
    destination.

    Returns None on success, or (exit_code, message) on failure: exit
    code 7 specifically for a lost no-force race against a concurrently
    created destination, exit code 1 for any other I/O failure (this
    includes tempfile.mkstemp() itself failing, which is handled here
    rather than left to propagate as an uncaught exception).
